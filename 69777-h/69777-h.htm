<p>The troop-ship was twenty-four hours before her
time in arriving, which put the authorities out, for
they like to take their leisure in Key Island and
as the thermometer rarely stands below 88° in the
shade they have some reason for their objection
to hurry. The bungalow which Government had
thoughtfully apportioned to the private secretary
and A.D.C. to the Administrator was not ready, and
word came down to the ship that he must please to
spend the night at the hotel, whereat Captain Alaric
Lewin swore in fluent English (he could have done
the same in five different languages) and wanted to
know why the several dashes Government had
parted him from his regiment and sent him to an
asterisk hole like Key Island, if they did not mean
to provide him with a blank shelter when he got
there. It was all very well for his predecessor, who
had been a bachelor; but Captain Lewin was a
married man, and a six-months-old husband to
boot. He objected to taking his wife to dubious
Colonial “hotels”—so-called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Out in the sunshine of the deck Mrs. Lewin was
sitting among her baggage (while she waited for her
lord and master to have arranged matters before
taking her ashore), because she knew no better, the
atmospheric conditions and effects of Key Island
being as yet a sealed book to her. She was watching
the men formed up and marched off the gangway,
and formed up again on the wharf, and finally
departing in a cloud of dust and sunshine to the
barracks on the Maitso Hill. Now and then an
officer saluted her in passing, and she nodded back
and smiled, for the five days out from Cape Town
had been worth an intimacy of three weeks on
shore. There was idle speculation in her gaze as it
rested on this small corner of the British Empire,
in which her present lot was cast; but in this present
moment of coming close to it Key Island was no
more than a flat picture on her mind of an absurd
little white town tufted with palms, and completely
overweighted by that harbour and the wharves
which the Government were converting into a great
coaling-station, the whole shut in by the exquisite
hills, loaded with timber and softly drawn against a
sky of pure deep blue. There is no bluer sky than
that which hangs above Key Island, and reflects
itself in the Mozambique Channel all round it on a
clear day, but Mrs. Lewin saw no more than the
outward semblance of the place. It takes characters
in a landscape to endue it with vitality either to
present sense or bitter memory. All she saw on
this occasion was the green slopes of Maitso and
Mitsinjovy, forming each side of the bay, and
beyond them the principal feature of the harbour,—two
great conical rocks, rising sheer from the sea
to the height of two thousand feet, which the English
call the Gates, but the native population, who
have caught strange words from Madagascar, name
Teraka and Tsofotra, Sunrise and Sunset. There
is a half-mile of blue water between the base of the
right and left Gate, and between them the troop-ship
had but lately passed, giving Mrs. Lewin a
profile view of their frowning sides. It was practically
impossible not to see the Gates, because they
were as giants in the landscape; but the significance
of their name and position, shutting in the little
tropical island at which she had but just arrived,
was as yet an unknown tongue to her. She had
not heard them close softly behind her, and bar the
way to the outer world, as residents grow to fancy
that they have after a while.</p>

<p>“Port Victoria!” said Mrs. Lewin musingly, her
thoughts reverting to the tumbled houses and the
windy palms. “I wonder if it will ever grow up
to its name? At present it might be called Little
Vic.”</p>

<p>Her thoughts were distracted by the white figure
of her husband coming along the deck, and distinct
against the other units in khaki as a white sheep
amongst a flock of brown. He was immaculate,
but cross, and one end of his moustache was caught
between his teeth, and his handsome face looked
darker than usual because he did not appear upon
the edge of a smile, which was his normal expression.</p>

<p>“We must go to the hotel, Chum,” he said.
“No help for it. Come out of the sun. What
made you sit there?”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel it very hot. Don’t bother about
me, Ally, I expect the hotel will be bearable—you
wouldn’t mind it for yourself.” The habit of a lifetime,
rather than the relationship of six months, had
taught Leoline Lewin to classify every shade on her
husband’s face with sub-conscious accuracy. She
had no least intention of knowing Ally’s mind for
him, but she did it all the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“There is no help for it, anyway,” Captain Lewin
said. “I’ve got a buggy—our luggage will come
up behind us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin followed him off the boat and across
the dusty road to the Customs House, and so
through the farce of having their luggage examined,
to the ramshackle conveyance drawn by a
broken-kneed pony, which was bunched up forlornly
in the shade of the Customs House.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we go up by tram, Ally?” she said, a
little comically. “This is so musty—and the trams
look quite clean and airy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are only intended for the niggers,
going up and down from the coaling, or for people
connected with the wharves!” remarked Captain
Lewin with unusual irony. “Everything exists
here simply to be a convenience to the wharves and
the coaling, you will find. Mere human beings
don’t count in the new Government scheme!” He
helped her into the buggy, and flung his own big
dissatisfied self into the seat beside her, which
creaked beneath his weight, for Captain Lewin rode
twelve stone for his five feet eleven inches. The
buggy rumbled along, pitching like a ship, and gave
Mrs. Lewin a glimpse of open stores and motley
groups of coloured people, an undrained street, and
now and then a large, hard building, obviously new
and solid, and as out of keeping with the older
houses as the town with the harbour. The whole
place had an unfinished appearance, as of a production
begun by one workman and put down as
hopeless, and then taken up by another who had
not yet matured his plan for improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>The buggy came to a stop before one of the
older houses, a long rough bungalow with a wide
stoep, and empty doorways like open mouths, in
and out of which a small white Chinaman passed
now and then, monotonously bent on business.
These were the waiters and servants of the Hotel
Natale, who bore the badge of the place on their
grass-cloth liveries, and the caps on their heads,
which, by the way, they only wore until it should
be time to shave themselves, according to the laws
of Confucius. They swarmed out of the place like
the white ants on the wooden railing to the stoep,
spread themselves on the luggage in the hinder
cart, and carried Captain and Mrs. Lewin into the
hotel in a whirlwind of their own property.</p>

<p>“Get us two rooms—and be quick about it!”
Alaric said shortly. “I’m very sorry, Chum—but
at all events it’s a place to rest and clean up in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>His wife had passed him and walked into the cool
shadows beyond the stoep with some interest and
curiosity in her face. She was a tall girl, and had
an enquiring way of carrying her chin, but her interest
was really unfeigned, for beyond England her
experiences had been limited to the Continent, and
there was nothing Continental in the Hotel Natale.
Before Mrs. Lewin stretched a long carpetless passage,
some seventeen feet high, and lighted by one
large whitewashed window at the further end. It
was the only real window, with glass panes, in Port
Victoria, as she afterwards found, and its proprietor
was proud of it. All the rest consisted of frames
filled with wooden blinds, or shutters that would
shift up and down, to let in the air or shut out the
light. The windows in Mrs. Lewin’s bedroom were
on this plan, as she found when the Chinese scurried
before her and piled her boxes in the middle of the
huge bare room. There was neither light nor bell
in the hotel, but they brought her one candle, and
Ally’s dressing-room was next door, so she managed
as best she might. By-and-by she wandered
in to him to see how he fared, and found his apartment
the counterpart of her own, as to furnishing—a
narrow bed, with a dirty mosquito curtain over it,
a chest of drawers, without paint or key, a basket-work
chair, a washstand, and a looking-glass.
Captain Lewin in his shirt-sleeves appeared the
most valuable thing in the room. A good-looking
man is never more good-looking than in that
severely simple costume, and despite the fact that he
was red from wrestling with his shirt case, and
swearing at the hotel and all its resources all over
again, he seemed to his wife a goodly possession.</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you doing, Ally?” Mrs. Lewin said,
coming to the rescue, and taking the keys out of
his hand with cool, soft fingers. “Here, you helpless
boy, I’ll valet you to-night. I suppose the
Chinese are not reliable?”</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose they know the use of a stud,
except to loot it. It’s awfully good of you, Chum.
Got it open, already? I’ll engage a man before
I’m many hours older. But look here, if you’ll unpack
the things I shall want, I’ll go and get you
some tea!”</p>

<p>She laughed at the wheedling tone, and accepted
the bribe. Even at five o’clock in the day it was
hot, with the clinging, muscle-sapping heat of the
tropics, but Chum had the vitality and sting of an
English winter still in her veins, and did not suffer
as yet. She did some unpacking—her own as well
as Ally’s—and drank the tea he ordered in lieu of
his own whiskey and soda; and then she dressed
for dinner, coming into his room again to have her
blouse fastened, for it hooked at the back. Ally
was in a better temper; he manipulated the complicated
fastening wonderfully with his large hands,
and stooped to kiss his wife’s pretty neck.</p>

<p>“You’re too good to be wasted on this damned
hole—beg pardon, Chum!” he said, “I wish I’d
got you out to Malta, or some other decent
station.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“What does it matter, old boy? The blouse is
just as pretty for you to look at on Key Island, and
you can’t hope for Malta at your age without unprecedented
luck. Let’s make the best of our step
up—private secretary and A.D.C. is something,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“I expect it will be too, with this man. I was
told at Cape Town he was a Tartar.”</p>

<p>“Know anything of him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. He’s been somewhere on the Indian
frontier, quelling rebellions without much ceremony,
and a good deal of unofficial slaughter. The
Government always sends him out when there’s
trouble to squash, and then censures him when he’s
done it. He’s here now to expiate his sins, his
measures having been a little too drastic to be
winked at any longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Chum thoughtfully, “he must be
one of our few strong men. And they are worth
having behind you, Ally. Let us annex the Administrator,
you and I, and make him the good
geni of our fortunes!”</p>

<p>“It would be the first time that Gregory was
any one’s good geni!” said Ally dryly. “They
say he works his men to death, and when he can
get no more out of ’em, he throws ’em aside like
a spent cartridge-case. Come on, Chum—that
fiendish row on a gong means some sort of a meal,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Is my hair all right?” said Mrs. Lewin carelessly,
as she tucked her hand into his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>He looked down at her somewhat critically, for
he set much store by appearance, and nodded.
From his point of view it was unfortunate that
Leoline was cast in too individual a mould to be
turned out quite like the well-groomed, clean young
Englishwoman whom the Mother Country breeds
in serviceable batches as wives for sensible men.
But common-sense had done much for Mrs. Alaric
Lewin, and had made her as near her husband’s
ideal as Nature would go. It was really only her
hair which gave Chum much anxiety now, for its
splendid weight and ripples did not lend themselves
very well to the mode of the moment, but she
laboured with it earnestly, and by the aid of a hair-net
gave it something the sameness of other
women’s. She had no desire to be conspicuous.</p>

<p>“It’s all right—but don’t wear it over your ears,
whatever you do!” Ally advised, as they went
down the empty, echoing passage arm in arm.
“We can stand anything but that.”</p>

<p>“But, Ally, it’s the fashion—which doesn’t
matter; and a pretty one—which does!”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it. Men always hate it. When we
see a woman with her hair dressed so, we always say
she hasn’t washed her ears this morning!”</p>

<p>“Pigs!” said Chum, laughing. “It’s your own
unclean minds. Ally, isn’t the waiter the image of
Ah Sin!”</p>

<p>“Yes, says his name’s Chun Low, or some such
variation—but it doesn’t matter. Have some
chicken, Chum—I’m afraid it’s not up to much.”</p>

<p>“I never quarrel with my food,” said Chum contentedly,
attacking the tough fowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>The coffee-room at the Natale was like a parochial
hall, or an arcade at some exhibition, both on
account of its size and its bareness. It was an immense
place, built out from the rest of the bungalow
as if to allow of more room, though evidently in no
hope of custom, for there were but five small tables
in all its desert space. These were spread with
coarse cloths and such table cutlery as should suffice
to take away a diner’s appetite. Mrs. Lewin
made a face at her dingy pewter, and amused herself
with looking round the walls for distraction.
There was nothing to be seen but some dilapidated
fans and a square of coloured muslin on a stick
which bore some far-off resemblance to a flag.
Outside the three or four long doors the day was
still lingering among the creepers and shrubs on the
stoep, for green things seemed to flourish there in
tubs, and three dirty basket-chairs converted the
place into a popular lounge. It was infinitely forlorn.
Chum looked away again, towards the waiter
this time, and observed that he was trying to attract
Ally’s attention, which was just then riveted upon
the fowl’s iron joints.</p>

<p>“Ally,” she said, “I think Ah Sin wants to tell
you something—he’s either going to have a fit, or
it’s Anglo-Saxon attitudes!”</p>

<p>Lewin turned round quickly, to find that the
Chinese waiter had come to his elbow, evidently
with some more important news than the next
course of a bad dinner. The guests at his table
were lunatics to the mind of the Chinaman, who
could not use his name of Chung Low, but must
needs call him by some one else’s. Furthermore
they joked and laughed like children, and made
comments on their surroundings and on himself
which were nonsense, and which should not alter a
line of his outward imperturbability.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Lewin impatiently.</p>

<p>“One piecey man he come see you!” said Chung
Low without a crease of expression in his yellow
face.</p>

<p>The corners of Chum’s mouth lifted deliciously.
Ally dared not meet her eyes across the table.</p>

<p>“Which piece of him, Ah Sin?” she said, leaning
her chin in her hands and looking gravely at the
Chinaman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Chum!” said Ally warningly, under his breath.
Indeed he was choked with laughter. “Er—you
can show him in, boy!” he added, with a rather
larger manner than usual to impress the Celestial,
and Ally was never very condensed. “I expect it’s
one of the fellows from barracks come down to see
if he can do anything,” he added vaguely to his
wife. “People are generally so deuced friendly in
a station like this that it becomes a bore. Might
have left us to our dinner, anyhow, such as it is.
Still we can’t say no—can we?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Besides, I want to see if he is
whole!” said the irrepressible Chum. “Here
comes Ah Sin—bowing before a young man who
looks all teeth!” (Chum could see the advance
along the stoep of the hotel, to which Ally had his
back.) “Now he is making Anglo-Saxon attitudes
before him. Oh, Ally, do get up and meet him
first—I know I’m going to laugh!... <i>Well!</i>”</p>

<p>The last exclamation was due to the fact that
Ally had risen at her desire, but no sooner did he
see his visitor than he made a stride forward to
meet him, and the visitor being equally impetuous
the next few seconds presented a confused babel of
greeting to Mrs. Lewin’s amazed eyes and ears.</p>

<p>“Hulloa, <i>Bristles</i>!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s old Ally Sloper!”</p>

<p>“What luck blew you here? You’re not with
the regiment—the Wessex?”</p>

<p>“Yes I am. Changed from the Rutlandshire
after the African show. Not seen you but once
since Sandhurst, Ally—are you our new A. D. C. to
Gregory’s Powder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, worse luck! This is a nice beginning—no
quarters, and obliged to bring my wife to this sort
of shanty! Oh, Chum—this is an old pal who
was at Sandhurst with me. Captain Nugent—Mrs.
Lewin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>One of Ally’s most salient characteristics was
that he could use slang and remain a gentleman.
As she shook hands with his friend Mrs. Lewin inwardly
commented upon the fact that the same indulgence
would convert Captain Nugent into a
coster. He stared at her with eyes which were
burnt by much foreign service, and seemed to approve
of the survey.</p>

<p>“I heard that a Captain Lewin was coming, but
never thought it was you,” he explained. “Fact
is, I came down to see if you were too tired to
come to the Gunnery, to-night—there’s a scratch
dance on, and, of course, as we didn’t expect
you till to-morrow, we couldn’t send you an invitation.”</p>

<p>“What’s the show?” said Ally lazily, as he lit a
cigarette. “You fellows?”</p>

<p>“No, the town cricket team. We had a match
this week, and they got up this hop as a finish.
It’s only a small thing, so you might waive ceremony
and come!” He looked at Mrs. Lewin’s
promising young figure as a man might a horse he
means to back.</p>

<p>“Are you too tired, Chum?” Ally said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I am never too tired to dance,” said Mrs. Lewin
with refreshing cordiality. “Wait till I get into
something less dinnery. I was afraid to before,
because it wouldn’t get dark and let us have
candles. There is nothing so disreputable as dining
by daylight—it makes one feel <i>décolletée</i> in the
highest gown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Both men laughed as she vanished through one
of the endless doorways. Then there was a silence
of some seconds while the cigarette smoke rose in
meditative threads. The man who thinks while he
smokes draws slowly, but if he is actively employed
he produces little woolly clouds.</p>

<p>“You’re married too, aren’t you?” said Ally,
looking across the table.</p>

<p>“Yes; left the missus at home. She isn’t strong
enough for this place.” Captain Nugent’s burnt
young eyes looked away from his friend as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Any family?”</p>

<p>“One,” said Nugent, knocking the ash on to the
bare boards of the floor to the inconvenience of the
ants who lived there. “It’s a tom!” he added
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>“D’you remember, we both vowed we’d marry
widows rather than a raw girl?” said Ally in
reminiscence. “By Jove! How I wished I
had.”</p>

<p>“It’s cornery at first. My wife told me what
struck her most was that I came in to speak to her
in my shirt-sleeves, and without thinking took up
one of her brushes and brushed my hair. She
thought, ‘What cheek!’”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one thing that stumps me now,”
said Ally.</p>

<p>“I know what you’re going to say—she buttons
her gowns from right to left.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen it too? Why the devil do they?
All our clothes go from left to right. I believe it’s
that that makes women always look at a thing hind-side
before—their very point of view grows topsy-turvy.”</p>

<p>“Ally!” came Mrs. Lewin’s voice from the doorway.
“Come and change your coat—you can’t
dance in a jacket. Captain Nugent, how are we to
get there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Both men rose rather guiltily. “I am afraid
you’ll have to ride, Mrs. Lewin,” Nugent said.
“Ponies, y’know. Every one does here. Can you
turn up your skirt? I’d get you a buggy, but there
are only three in Port Victoria, and they are all
hired for to-night.”</p>

<p>“Elementary, but exciting,” said Chum calmly.
“Go and get me a pony, that’s all, and I’ll show
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>She was as good as her word when the ponies
came round; they were rats of things, and the new
lady’s saddle which Mrs. Lewin had brought out
looked astonishingly big on the animal assigned
her. But she tucked up her silk skirts as if to the
manner born, and the procession clattered off from
the front of the hotel, audienced by half-a-dozen
Chinese, loafers of three dusky races—for Key
Island has a mixed population—and some lean
hens. The darkness had come at last, but out of
the irregular wooden houses shone the electric light
with the bizarre effect it always produces in such
elementary places. The ponies shambled along
at a miniature canter, and Leoline gripped the
pommel by habit with a dreamy remembrance that
some time since she had set a thoroughbred across
the finest hunting country in England. Such
things seemed to belong to another life, with the
smell of eucalyptus and moonflowers coming into
her nostrils on a warm, wet breeze, and the glimpses
of Port Victoria by electric flashes. They rocked
down the main street, and for an instant the quay
was on their left before they turned up-hill to their
destination; again she saw the grouped ravenala
palms, the huge wharves, the bay, and the grim
Gates at the harbour mouth, black sentinels against
the darkening sky. Then Captain Nugent steered
to the left, along a bad road where anything but a
Key’land pony would have stumbled, and suddenly
they emerged into the most wonderful avenue of
cocoanut palms, with soft sand underfoot, and as if
by common consent the up-hill canter changed to
a hard gallop.</p>

<p>“Look out!” Nugent called, pulling in beside
Mrs. Lewin. “This is Mitsinjovy Straight, the
only bit of flat land round about. They always
gallop here; mind!”</p>

<p>It was difficult to talk going at that pace, the
wind buffeting them with such violence. Mrs.
Lewin looked along the aisle of straight stems,
each with its crown-tuft far overhead, and said, “I
like it!” It seemed to her the most characteristic
spot in all the island, from first to last—that
wonderful avenue of cocoanuts where the ponies
were so glad to gallop!—and she was half regretful
when they pulled up before an old sugar factory
beyond the palms, a white, hoary-looking building,
evidently converted from the sugar industry to
other uses now-a-days.</p>

<p>“This is the Gunnery,” Captain Nugent explained.
“It’s the Gunners’ mess until their
quarters are finished. The men will take your
pony, Mrs. Lewin.”</p>

<p>Chum found the dressing-room full of women,
lingering to gossip with the assurance of already
filled programmes. Powder-puffs were going vigorously,
and the place was stuffy with wraps. She
tossed her cloak to an attendant, and rejoined her
escort, who awaited her at the ballroom door.
Nothing of the old sugar works remained, only the
shell of the barn-like building served now as a
shelter in which the gentlemen of the Royal
Artillery could dine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>It was as Nugent had said, a scratch dance, and
the Gunnery had not even been decorated, but
the floor was unexpectedly good, and the Wessex
had arranged a band of a sort on a rough staging.
Below this impromptu daïs stood several people at
whom Mrs. Lewin looked at once, with an instinct
for those of mark. There was a tall man with
thick silver hair, and a stout woman in black, a
jovial-looking parson, and another man with his
back to her, of whom she could not judge.
Nugent’s eyes followed hers.</p>

<p>“Those are the Seats of the Mighty there,” he
said. “The parson is Archie Lysle, our chaplain
(best fellow goin’!); the lady’s Mrs. White, and
the grey-haired Johnnie is her husband—he’s
Attorney-General.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the other man?” Ally asked.</p>

<p>“Halton, the Commissioner. Gregory’s Powder
half promised to turn up, but he went off to the
Tsara Valley yesterday morning, and I don’t expect
he is back. Halton is probably representing Government
House.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand this place,” said Chum,
knitting her brows. “When the Government took
over Key Island from the British African Island
Company——”</p>

<p>“Limited!” Ally put in significantly.</p>

<p>“Limited,—why did they send out an Administrator
<i>and</i> a Commissioner to enquire into the
riots? Surely the man who takes the responsibility
should be the one to find out what is wrong?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Halton’s the drag on the wheel,
and Gregory’s the wheel itself. Gregory’s a man
who is always sent into a tight place, but unless
they brigade him with a drag, he’d make it an
absolute monarchy—he’s a born slave ruler. So
they put Halton in to enquire, and Gregory to act
on the enquiry. See?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Chum’s whole thought was concentrated
into the word. “And does that succeed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t much know—and it don’t matter either
in such a beastly little corner as this. Can’t think
why we bother about the place at all. Let France
have it.”</p>

<p>“But we want it for a coaling-station, don’t we;
and it’s the key of the Mozambique Channel!”</p>

<p>“You’re thinking of the name—but Key’land
takes its name as much from its shape as anything,
or so they say. Besides, who cares about the
Mozambique Channel? I don’t know what Government
is up to, of course—don’t mind either, so
long as I get out of this pretty quick. We’ve been
here six months, and we’re all dead nuts on getting
away. May I have some dances, Mrs. Lewin?”
His tone had brightened.</p>

<p>Chum looked at him curiously as he wrote his
name on her programme, and in her own mind
contrasted him with Ally, and found him vastly
inferior. He could not even take an intelligent
interest in his surroundings, and she attributed it
to a certain curious formation in the back of his
head. It was flattened on the top, but curved out
from the neck too much to Mrs. Lewin’s critical
inspection. Ally, with a superior skull, would of
course be more intelligent; but she did not realise
that she intended him to be so by her own motive
power.</p>

<p>“Would you like to know Halton? He’s a very
decent chap,” Bristow Nugent said simply. “This
is quite an unofficial affair, y’know. No need for
ceremony. I’ll bring him over.”</p>

<p>He swung in and out of the thickening crowd
towards the band, but the dancing had begun, and
Mrs. Lewin’s programme had filled with the
men she had known on the troop-ship, and others
who followed in their wake. The evening was
half over before Captain Nugent fulfilled his
promise and brought the Commissioner up to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>He was a very quiet man in appearance, with
that instinctive colouring which in an Englishman
is always called fair, but his eyes were a dark-brown,
rather opaque, and had a trick of half closing while
he talked. He looked about forty, and the lines of
his clean-shaven face appealed to Chum as suggesting
humour.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have not had time to report
yourselves yet,” he said quizzically; “and as a fact
you are not due until to-morrow, so to-night’s appearance
must be regarded as a kind of provision
of good things.”</p>

<p>“There is no one to report oneself to, is there?
I hear that the Administrator is not in Port
Victoria.”</p>

<p>“He is standing behind you—not a dozen yards
away,” said Halton quietly. “If you turn round
as though suddenly struck by the attractiveness of
the band, you will be able to look at him at your
leisure.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and they both laughed, while
Mrs. Lewin did as suggested. There was no mistaking
the Administrator, because he happened to
be the only man near, and was walking towards
them with Mrs. White, the Attorney-General’s wife.
Evelyn Gregory was peculiar rather than attractive,
but more emphatic than either. He was considerably
taller than most men present, and was of that
spare build which made his dress suit look as if it
hung over a clothes-horse.</p>

<p>“He seems as if he were only on a bowing acquaintance
with his clothes, and was afraid of taking
liberties with them!” was Mrs. Lewin’s comment
to herself. “Evening dress appears more inappropriate
to him than to any man I ever saw.
Not that he is awkward either—but he looks too
tremendous for it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The Administrator was still advancing, and revealed
a long hatchet-shaped face, with an unusual
overhanging width at the temples. His hair was
reddish and cropped closely, and his features were
cast in a rather savage mould, the mouth hidden
by a huge moustache. His eyes were his most
distinguishing feature, being nearly lidless and
seeming to fill the whole socket, the effect being
that of extreme far sight and almost cruel keenness.
Mrs. Lewin was the more struck by their expression
in contrast to the Commissioner’s, but she could not
see their colour, for he was looking straight before
him, and speaking in what she at first thought was
an intentional undertone to Mrs. White.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you know Mrs. Lewin?” said
that lady, who had been talking to Chum earlier
in the evening, and now paused near her. “Mr.
Gregory!”</p>

<p>As Chum bowed she was conscious that the Administrator
looked at her, classified her in his own
mind, and dropped the very thought of her. He
lingered for a minute, expressing his regret that they
should have been forced to go to the hotel, but he
hoped their bungalow would be at their disposal to-morrow,
and Mrs. Lewin discovered that it was his
custom to speak in a rapid undertone like a forceful
whisper. The curiously concentrated effect of this
was uncanny. His words came below his breath,
but not one of them was lost. When he had
passed on, she turned to Mr. Halton with relief, to
find him regarding her in his turn.</p>

<p>“I cannot think how you do it!” he said
promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Do what?” said Chum, as they ensconced
themselves on two chairs in a corner, as if by tacit
consent. She made a furtive snatch at her mental
attitude as she spoke, for, to tell the truth, she had
been making use of that good gift of nature, her
eyes. Even in this brief few minutes she had found
Mr. Halton responsive.</p>

<p>“You come here,” said the Commissioner
thoughtfully, “in a perfectly fresh and smiling
gown. Yet you arrived this afternoon, and must
have untrunked it, as you could not have worn it
for landing.” He glanced at her so daintily as to be
free of offence; the pretty white shoulders were innocent
of sleeve, and the shoulder-strap was generous,
and hardly marred them. “I usually know the
packed look of a new arrival, but you have upset
my calculations.”</p>

<p>“I am sitting on the creases,” said Mrs. Lewin
amicably. “They are all in my tail! By the way,
Mr. Halton, are all the servants here Chinamen?”</p>

<p>“No; only at the hotel, and one or two houses
which believe in them. They are not very good
servants, though they compare favourably with
most of the ruffians who inhabit Key Island. The
fact is that no good Chinaman leaves China—the
best will hardly go out of their own districts.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do for servants, then?”</p>

<p>“I should advise your having Arabs. You begin
to think that this is a tower of Babel, I see; but
the fact is, we get Arabs from the Comoros, as well
as Chinese labour, like the Mauritius, and unless
you can pick and choose, they are easier to manage.
You can have a choice of evils, of course. There is
the African negro, who is deceitful and desperately
wicked, Creole and half-caste (but they won’t
work), and even some Malagasy. Would you like
a brace of Arabs to begin with?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” laughed Chum. “I suppose we
shall begin housekeeping to-morrow, and I tremble
when I think of my husband’s sufferings during my
novitiate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Turn him over to the club if he dares to grumble;
that will sober him. I will send you Abdallah
and Hafez, if I may. You will find them two very
average idiots. Make Hafez your cook and Abdallah
your butler, and they will find you the rest
of your household.”</p>

<p>“You are much better than a registry office!
But I feel I’m taking liberties with the Government.”</p>

<p>“We are terribly unofficial in Key’land!” said
the Commissioner, with a little grimace. “But a
week here will tell you more of the place than any
secrets I could give away. The fact is that the
Home Authorities are spring cleaning, and we are
living on the stairs and in the passages meanwhile,
after the manner of householders in such
circumstances.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin had absorbed a fair amount of information
even when she returned to the hotel that
night with her husband. It was their custom to
become confidential after a tour among strangers,
and to exchange experiences; but they took different
standpoints.</p>

<p>“I saw you talking to a red-haired woman,” said
Chum. “What was she like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rather nice. She knows the Tavistocks—Indian
people, you know. I was at the Pindi with
them.” Ally’s interest in people was usually
founded on mutual acquaintances.</p>

<p>“I thought she looked Army, herself. Who is
she?”</p>

<p>“A Mrs. Churton. Her husband is senior Major
of the Wessex and O.C.T. here. She is rather a
smart woman, I thought.” This was Ally’s
praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“But does she put all her goods in the shop
windows, so to speak? There are people like
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, her hair was all right, wasn’t it? And
she knows every one here.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Chum thoughtfully, letting down the
masses of her own irreclaimable hair, which objected
to being smart either in colour or fashion. “Then
I hope she will come to call soon.”</p>

<p>“How did you get on? And what did you think
of Bristles?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think of Bristles. But on the whole I
didn’t do badly. I was offered ten ponies to ride,
three men are coming to call on me with their wives
(not only sending their wives to call—it’s a broader
compliment), and the Commissioner is selecting all
the rogues and vagabonds in the island for my
servants!”</p>

<p>“The Commissioner! I thought it was the Administrator
you were going to annex.”</p>

<p>“I am feeling round at present. If I see that he
is the right man to advance our fortunes, Ally,
nothing can save him!”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you had better keep to Halton. I
heard all round that Gregory’s Powder is a stiff dose.
Lysle—that chaplain fellow—tells me that every
woman out here has had a shot at him, and never
made more than a fleeting impression.”</p>

<p>“If he sets up as a woman-hater, he is a foregone
conclusion,” said Chum scornfully. “He seemed
on excellent terms with that stout woman, Mrs.
White, though.”</p>

<p>“He is on excellent terms with them all, and
with no one in particular. He is absorbed in his
work wherever it is, they say, and the worst of it is
he’s a slave driver. I’m going to have a lovely
time of it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>He looked so really rueful and impressed that
Chum opened her charming eyes with a little
laugh.</p>

<p>“Why, Ally,” she said, “you are all making a little
tin god of him,—and I can’t think why!”</p>

<p>“He is the Administrator of Key Island, and a
hard nut to crack. Perhaps that is why.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“My dear fellow, he is—only a man!”</p>

<p>To understand the overwhelming military flavour
in the society of Key Island, it must be remembered
that Port Victoria is girdled with the garrison,
and that the garrison is stationary, whereas the
cruisers only put in to coal, and at the best stay
three weeks on one excuse or another. The naval
flavour, therefore, is general, but indistinct; whereas
one cannot get away from the smell of khaki, go
where one will. On the right, as one enters the
harbour, is Teraka, the Gate of Sunrise, and behind
this, though unconnected with it, rises Maitso Hill
with its solid quarters for troops; on the left Tsofotra,
or the Sunset Gate, is flanked in the same way by
the lower slopes of Mitsinjovy. When the Lewins
arrived in Key Island Maitso was occupied by the
Wessex, and the Gunners were in hurricane huts at
Mitsinjovy, pending the completion of their barracks,
which were to accommodate yet more batteries as
soon as finished; add to this the usual percentage
of A.S.C., R.A.M.C., and A.P.D., and the result is
that from nine to twelve, when the men go out of
uniform, Port Victoria is nothing but a parade
ground, and every man at afternoon tennis looks as
if he missed a stripe down his trousers. There are
civilians, of course (Leoline Lewin counted three
that she knew after a residence of as many weeks),
but they are not enough to leaven the lump, and so
the social world remains Official and Military, and
the aristocracy of the place are always those who
are most ferociously Army. Mrs. Lewin had two
great advantages, when she was introduced to the
station, over most of the young married women
who fought a mental battle for their rights before
they established themselves in the uppermost seats
of the synagogue—Captain Lewin belonged to a
very much smarter regiment than either the Wessex
or the Artillery then at Port Victoria; and also, he
was not attached to the garrison. Therefore Chum
started with an insured position that could not be
torn from her, and yet rivalled no other lady’s. Incidentally,
she was also much better looking than
any other woman in the island, and she knew how
to put on her clothes, which is a gift quite apart
from possessing the garments themselves, or even
the taste to choose them. When they had talked
her over at the club, from the ripples of her pretty
hair to her openwork stockings and American
shoes, the married men did a shrewd thing, and
waited for their wives to mention her first, while the
unmarried went to call without waiting for Sunday—which
is a great compliment, because by the law
of Port Victoria Sunday is the day set aside for visiting,
it not being etiquette to play polo or dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The Alaric Lewins took their married life as a
huge joke, a point of view which speedily communicated
itself to Key Island, who proceeded to laugh
with them over the situation. They had been
brought up together, Mrs. Lewin’s father having
been Alaric’s guardian, and an admiration of Ally
had been amongst the rudiments of Chum’s education.
At intervals Alaric had disappeared out of
her life to Harrow, and Sandhurst, and India, always
to reappear a good deal handsomer and better mannered
and more travelled. His view of life was
necessarily larger than her own by forced experience;
but the girl, left at home, knew more deeply
by theory than the man by practice. At twenty-six
a woman who thinks is in a very dangerous position
if she has had no actual experience to reduce
her ideas of life to the level of reality. But
Leoline looked innocent enough of anything out
of the common, when seen against the background
of her home. Captain Lewin was much influenced
by surroundings; he saw a solid position in the
county, irreproachable frocks, popularity with men
and women alike, and a coveted possession by others
of his kind, while the unimportant item of a
girl’s individuality, which was the centrepiece of all
this, he took for granted. Leoline, the victim of
her own theories, found the relations between them
hardly altered after the clergyman of the parish,
who had hitherto behaved like a gentleman, said
very rude things to her from the altar rails, for which
he had scriptural authority. She congratulated herself
that she was still Ally’s “Chum,” and made
their interests one with a touch of comradeship in
the wifehood. Her knowledge of the man she had
married consisted in the fact that he was nearly six
feet in height and well built, that he had a well-shaped
dark head, and a handsome face, that he had
always had good manners and appearance, and that
they were excellent companions. Marriage, to Chum,
meant a certain amount of mutual toleration and
avoidance of friction, whereby she called it a success.
It seemed to her that she and Ally had done
the same thing from their nursery days; they must
certainly have learned all of each other that there
was to learn by now. But in an indefinite future
she believed that he was to do great things, because
she could not imagine herself the wife of a man who
was a failure.</p>

<p>A week in Key Island revealed the inner workings
of its life, as Halton had said it would, but the
Lewins still knew different sides of it. Alaric’s
duties tied him to Government House as he had
predicted, but he escaped to play tennis and to ride
and bathe after the manner of his kind. There was
an heroic effort at a polo ground too, but things
being on an eternal slant in the island, the game
had to be played on a gentle slope. Gentlemen of
the home clubs, who swear at a daisy tuft, think of
the pathos of this, and see how exiled brothers can
follow the sport abroad! Leoline, by the grace of
Hafez and Abdallah, was free early in the day, but
squandered her liberty in reducing her house to
order. She did not care to ride out to tennis much
before the hour when her husband could arrive there
also, and it even sometimes happened that she would
for preference go for a gallop through the cocoanuts
up and down Mitsinjovy Straight, so that he had
got home and changed, and was at their mutual
destination before her. This happened one day
about a week after their arrival; Mrs. Lewin had
ordered her pony for four o’clock, but the day
clouded over, and the sky over Maitso was so
threatening that she gave up her gallop and half
hesitated about going to the further garrison. As,
however, tennis was on at Mrs. Churton’s this afternoon,
and as Ally liked Mrs. Churton, she decided
to ride up to Maitso, anyhow, and cantered soberly
away, past the gates of Government House, and,
leaving Port Victoria to the right, began to climb
the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>It was a steep climb, and the pony sobered at
once to a walk. No Key’land pony can trot—either
he walks or he canters, and even that he does
in a manner peculiarly his own, using three of his
legs to the distinct saving of the fourth. As Liscarton
dug his toes into the dust and hitched his
lean quarters upwards, Mrs. Lewin turned in the
saddle and looked down at the view, which was
gaining an indefinite fascination for her—the town,
the harbour, and the gates. The two cone-shaped
rocks had a threatening appearance to-day, with the
low loose clouds nearly touching their crests, and
there was a sullen light upon everything. Even
the sun-soaked green of the hills cuddled round
Port Victoria were draped with passing veils of rain
that were being blown over them and down towards
the town. It was not as yet wet at Maitso, though
it had been threatening all day, and the Lewins’
bungalow, being on a level with Government House,
had also escaped with an angry shower.</p>

<p>“Shall we have a storm, boy?” said Chum, as
she rode into the Churtons’ yard and delivered her
pony to a loafing servant. The groom nodded, and
murmured an assent in Arabic or Malagasy—she
had not yet learned to know which—but with so
obvious a disbelief in the weather that she hastened
her steps into the house in consequence. He was
right, for the first large drops splashed on to the
roof of the stoep, even as the butler bowed her into
the drawing-room through one of its many doors;
and the clouds darkened the day so that the carefully
shaded room was really dusky after the outside
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Churton happened to be crossing the room,
and greeted Mrs. Lewin on the way. She was of
a type that wears the regimental badge as a waist-buckle,
and seems proud of a weather-beaten skin
as proof that she has followed the drum through
many climates. Chum glanced at the hair that
Ally had said was “All right,” and saw that Diana
Churton had tightened a coiffeur in the <i>Queen</i> into
a form entirely unbecoming to her face. Her
instinct could not approve, but her judgment
meekly followed Ally’s.</p>

<p>There were many people crowded into the little
room who would have spread themselves out comfortably
upon the tennis courts, but thus condensed
seemed to Chum too complicated to be greeted in
detail. So she remained where she had drifted, near
an open window, and watched the storm. It had
begun to rain, as it always does there, with half-a-dozen
great drops, like the first tears of a breaking
grief, and then as if a window opened in heaven
and an angry God threatened to drown the earth a
second time. For some minutes it was impossible
to hear anything but the shouting of the rain as it
drove past; but after a few minutes it softened to a
steady hissing whisper, and the conversation in the
room behind her caught Mrs. Lewin’s idle attention.
She wondered what was absorbing the party, and
turned to hear. Mrs. Churton had had a large
volume in her hands when she spoke to her latest
guest, which she promptly deposited upon Ally’s
knee—Chum had recognised his flat shoulders and
oval dark head, though his back was towards her—and
a minute later she gained the key to the
mystery.</p>

<p>“My husband always takes about two hundred
pounds worth with him for exchange,” Mrs. Churton
was saying. “There’s the variation, Captain
Lewin—see the difference between DIE I and II?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got this,” Ally’s voice chimed in.
“DIE II has a clean engraved cut under the eye,
hasn’t it? But you’ve beaten me in shades.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“I can get ten pounds for that one penny on five
shilling dull rose Barbadoes of mine!” broke in another
voice.</p>

<p>“You’re a specialist, aren’t you, Mr. Lysle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I only take the Portuguese colonies. A
collector really has no time for more than one corner
of the world, if he does it seriously.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Churton laughed rather loudly. “I’m not
serious enough to confine myself to one country.
I take anything that comes in my way—the more
valuable the better. Bute says he wouldn’t trust
me with his own common duplicates.”</p>

<p>“Stamps!” said Chum blankly, under her breath.
It was so long since she had helped to arrange
those little coloured squares of paper in a fancy
album with Ally, that she had not realised that the
usual boy’s hobby had grown up into Philately—a
fearsome disease that ravages both Services all the
world over. Not being a “collector” herself, she
stood by in amazed amusement while the jargon of
the cult rang across the room, until she became
aware that Mr. Halton had appeared at her side,
without her having known him to be in the room.</p>

<p>“Disgusting weather, isn’t it?” he said, as they
shook hands. “For those who want to play tennis.
I am afraid the crops want water so badly that, as a
government official, I must rejoice, however.”</p>

<p>“Is rain wanted?” said Mrs. Lewin, with interest.
“What for? The cane? I wish you would
talk about Key Island a little, Mr. Halton!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it interests me. I have been trying to
pump my husband for information all the week, but
he is an unsatisfactory person, and won’t explain
things to me. When one understands a thing oneself,
it is difficult to realise the ignorance of other
people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The Commissioner looked at her beneath his
drooping eyelids, and there was some speculation in
his glance.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is like most Key’landers, and feels
no interest in the island himself?” he remarked
drily. “Most of the victims whom Government
has chained here for three years think of nothing
those three years but getting away!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know they do; but it seems rather silly,
don’t you think? Why should people always live
in the future, or the past, when it is really the
present that matters? As I am in Key Island, I
have a deep interest in Key Island—I belong to
her, and every move of the Government makes me
long to know their plans still more!”</p>

<p>“You should talk to the Administrator,” said
Halton, laughing. “He is the only man likely to
encourage you. I must confess I have some
sympathy with the people who hate this place,
though I can’t share Gregory’s enthusiasms.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you are only a passing compliment
from the Colonial Office, are you not? and we cannot
expect to keep you! Major Churton told me
yesterday that they would hardly spare you from
more important places much longer. But why do
you hate Key’land?”</p>

<p>Halton looked out of the window at the clearing
sky. The rain had ceased as suddenly as it had
begun, and overhead was the pure deep blue that
Mrs. Lewin was beginning to associate with the place.</p>

<p>“It’s a rat-trap!” said the Commissioner, glancing
up into the hollow heavens. “One of the rat-traps
that connect all the British Empire. And
already the rats are beginning to run round and
round and find no way of escape.”</p>

<p>But the words held no present meaning for
Chum’s ears. She was listening half-idly to the
scraps of conversation in the room behind her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“I have got the Provincial issue for St. Thomas
when they surcharged the two cents on three cent
stamps until the mail could get in with more of the
current issue!”</p>

<p>“By Jove! that’s ten shillings in the catalogue at
least.”</p>

<p>“Yes, old man, but it isn’t in the market, as
there’s no price quoted for it!”</p>

<p>Then Ally laughed, and Chum smiled in sympathy.
Ally’s sense of humour was easily tickled,
and his laugh was infectious. Mrs. Churton’s metallic
voice rang above the babel.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow he had Zanzibar complete, and
they say it’s worth a thousand!”</p>

<p>“No, he hadn’t—he couldn’t get the one rupee
unused slate, small second, after all.”</p>

<p>“The only things to go for now-a-days are new
issues—all the old ones are too rare.”</p>

<p>“What’s that Turk’s Island twopence halfpenny
on penny dull red, that Mrs. Ritchie Stern had from
Captain Tullock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a beauty! I offered her an old Pacific
Steam Navigation stamp for it, but she wouldn’t
exchange.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! It’ll be as common as Black English
in a little while.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a lovely set—those Venezuelans!
And do you notice that the over-print is different
in just one out of the whole sheet? I wrote to the
paper about it, and they took no notice. I’m positive
there’s a variation.”</p>

<p>Five heads were eagerly bent over a square half
inch of printed paper, while a chorus of indistinguishable
argument arose that made Mrs. Lewin
laugh out loud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“I never yet met any one closely connected with
the Navy or Army who did not possess a collection
of stamps worth at least a thousand pounds!” remarked
Halton drily, following her glance.</p>

<p>“And did they ever realise the thousand
pounds?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, not personally. You heard their ingenuous
remarks about catalogues and market
prices! But then they never want to sell—personally.
They know some one, however, who did so.
It is generally Browne who had the <i>Taradiddle</i> on
the El Dorado Station, unless it is Smyth of the
1,000!”</p>

<p>“I know so many men in that regiment!” said
Chum sweetly, “and they are all such nice fellows,
too! The Duke of Humbug’s Own, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the regimental motto is, ‘When you
tell a lie, tell a good one!’—the badge, a chimera
seen in a mirage!”</p>

<p>They had no time to laugh, because Mrs.
Churton’s voice was heard across the room, earnestly
expostulating with Ally.</p>

<p>“The colours on the red Brazilian unpaid letter-stamp
won’t stand steaming. You had better try
wet blotting-paper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, come outside!” said Halton impatiently,
pushing open the shuttered window-frame, and
holding out his hand to help his companion over
the step. Mrs. Lewin followed him down the stoep
and into a narrow path lightly flanked by logwood.
Three ravenala palms stood sentinel outside the
quarters of the O.C.T., their split fans looking like
raised hands to her imagination. The ravenala is
the “Traveller’s Tree,” and is tapped for water by
enterprising tourists; but it is too common in
Key’land to excite the inhabitants, who look upon
it as any other palm. To Mrs. Lewin it had become
somehow symbolic of the place, and she
liked its solemn hands outspread above her head,
and regretted that there did not happen to be a
single specimen at the bungalow. Besides the
ravenalas and the logwood, the Churtons’ quarters
were singularly treeless, but they owned one of the
three tennis courts in Port Victoria. Maitso and
Mitsinjovy are not remarkable for flat spaces of
ground, and the Churtons were esteemed fortunate.
All the houses on Maitso Hill had been apportioned
to married officers when the troops were first quartered
there, and as the paths zigzagged up and
down the steep incline, each sharp curve would
reveal a small bungalow, until the long line of
actual barracks crowned the crest. From a distance
it looked as if one house were hung above
another, tier on tier in the green, but a nearer acquaintance
proved the garrison more rugged than
picturesque. At Mitsinjovy the officers’ quarters,
being new and specially built for them, were of a
more regular type, and proportionately hideous;
but Maitso had been a favourite residence to the old
planters, and when given over to the Wessex, they
counted themselves luckier than the Gunners.
Halton and Mrs. Lewin sauntered as far as the tennis
courts, and there paused, looking down on the
best view of Port Victoria and the bay that Key
Island affords, while they talked in desultory fashion.</p>

<p>“So you are interested in Key’land!” said the
Commissioner meditatively. “Have you seen anything
of the island yet?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but Port Victoria—and the docks!”
said Mrs. Lewin, with a laughing glance at the
forests of masts far off in the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“I am glad you give the Government hobby its
chance—but you should have said the Docks, the
Harbour, the Coaling Wharves, and—Port Victoria!
That is the correct order. We are merely here on
sufferance, as Government House bears witness!
Would you like me to take you out to China Town,
I wonder?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I should—if I knew anything about
it. Where is China Town?”</p>

<p>“It is on the other side of that hill,”—he pointed
up the valley to an undiscovered inland. “It is the
headquarters of the Chinese here, and we suspect
at the root of the mischief. They have got some
place where they brew this abominable form of
hashish which sends the ordinary native mad, and
makes him get up riots and kill white people—you
see? But as yet we have not absolutely spotted
John Chinaman brewing in any large quantities, and
we cannot condemn on isolated instances. You are
really interested, Mrs. Lewin!”</p>

<p>Chum laughed a little, conscious that her wide
eyes were alight with the absorption of the moment,
and Mr. Halton laughed too. It was one of his
chief attractions to her that he never paid her a
compliment, or made a personal remark; and yet
his quiet admiration was as patent to her as the
noisy homage of duller men.</p>

<p>“I am extremely interested! Is that your theory
as to the cause of the rioting?”</p>

<p>“The real cause, certainly. The oppression and
low wage that was offered as an excuse is nothing
to a logical mind dealing with these people. There
are the innocent hemp-crops, and there are the
wily yellow man and the fools of blacks. But as
yet we have not the connecting link. They complained
of <i>corvée</i> (forced labour), it is always the
plea—but we complain of ganja with much more
reason!”</p>

<p>“And do these people profess to cultivate hemp
for export?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“A Chinaman, dear lady, will profess anything—save
the truth. It is all <i>pidgeon</i> to use his own
universal expression. But if you will get up very
early to-morrow—say be in the saddle by seven—I
will take a day off and expound the ethics of China
Town to you, with spectacular views as illustrations.
Will you come?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure. But can’t you tell me—Ah!
what a pity!”</p>

<p>The compliment contained in the genuine exclamation
was perfect because impromptu. It was
caused by the arrival on the scene of Captain
Nugent, Mrs. Churton, and Ally, no longer talking
of stamps but of tennis.</p>

<p>“Is it too wet to play, d’you think?” Diana
Churton said to the Commissioner and Mrs. Lewin
long before she reached them. “That’s the worst
of grass—I wish we had gravel courts like that
stuck-up Mrs. Bertie used to tell us they had in the
Cape. D’you remember her, Brissy? My husband
used to call her pea-hen!”</p>

<p>“Was she stuck-up? I thought she made herself
rather friendly,”—Captain Nugent’s voice was
equally strident to Mrs. Lewin’s ears. “She was
telling some story about the <i>State</i> theatricals very
first time I met her, and Jordan coming on the
stage dead drunk! Rather good tale she made of
it too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Chum began to see that she would have to like
Brissy in spite of herself, if it were to be done at all.
A sudden impatience of the chatter round her seized
her with the tantalising glimpse of more exciting
things to hear of from Halton. Five seconds later
she changed her mental attitude, and condemned
herself for her own lack of adaptability. It was one
of her theories that the immediate thing was the one
to grasp and develop as best might be, which mental
schooling resulted in her becoming involved in a
game of cat’s-cradle with Captain Nugent, who was
playing with a piece of string which had been tied
round the stamps album. Brissy had no conception
of mental flirtations undermining even a discussion
on hemp-growing round China Town; but he knew
that if he got “fish-in-the-pond” his large hands
would very likely touch Mrs. Lewin’s in the manipulation
of the string. Ally had gone to find
their ponies for the return home, and by the time
he reappeared the Commissioner had also extricated
himself after his quiet fashion and started with
them.</p>

<p>“Then you will come for a ride to-morrow?” he
said to Chum carelessly. “I am going to show
your wife China Town, Lewin—she displays such a
flattering interest, that Government cannot afford to
allow it to die for lack of cultivation. You were
there yesterday, eh?”</p>

<p>“I was!” said Ally significantly. “The most
beastly hot ride I ever had. You had better be
careful what time of day you go, Chum.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Halton says seven <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>”</p>

<p>“I wish the Administrator had said seven <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>!”
said Ally, laughing good-humouredly. “Instead of
that he said twelve—at a minute’s notice.”</p>

<p>“He does not spare himself!” said Halton, with
a shrug of his shoulders. “And he sees no reason
to spare other people. Our paths divide here, I
am sorry to say. Yours is the shorter cut, Mrs.
Lewin.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye till to-morrow, then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>She turned in her saddle, her face framed in by
the Panama hat she wore for riding, her eyes in the
shadow, a new shade in which the Commissioner
had not yet surprised them. He reined his own
pony’s head round into the winding path that made
a carriage-drive to Government House, while the
Lewins rode straight on. Their bungalow lay only
a few hundred yards further down the direct road,
with a short cut through their own plantation to
Government House. It was by this private path
that Ally went to his work every morning and
returned—the click of the rough gate dividing the
grounds being Chum’s signal for the first luncheon
bell; but visitors, or the residents of Government
House themselves, had a half-mile of winding path
and tangled green before they emerged opposite the
long straight building where the Union Jack flew
above lines of blank window-frames and the straight
pillars of the stoep. There were two stories to
Government House; it could accommodate some
thirty people independently of servants, and the
Administrator and Commissioner, alone in their
glory, called it a useful barn.</p>

<p>As Halton rode slowly along under the palms he
was hardly thinking of the ethics of China Town,
being too busy in breaking the tenth commandment.
He was a man who had always hankered
after the unattainable, and been afraid to risk what
he had for what he desired. He had seen many
pretty women, whom he thought of regretfully as
possible wives—after they had been married by other
men. The old process was beginning again in his
mind, but the outcome of it was merely a half-irritated
remark to the Administrator across the
<i>tête-à-tête</i> dinner-table.</p>

<p>“What on earth made you send Lewin out to
China Town in the heat of the day? It’s enough
to kill a man!”</p>

<p>“There was no one else to send,” said Gregory
simply, looking up in momentary surprise from
helping himself to fried banana. “I had a
message for Burton. <i>He’s</i> a good man if you
like.”</p>

<p>“And not to be wasted. It wouldn’t matter if
Lewin were used up, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Gregory shrugged his shoulders. “What on
earth did Government mean by sending me a
Mediterranean Station man?” he said in his repressed
tones. “Who am I to depend on when
you go?”</p>

<p>“He may wake up.”</p>

<p>“He’ll play tennis.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea his wife may push him through,”
said the Commissioner slowly, poking a hard-back
beetle with his forefinger as he spoke. He was
looking at the insect as he spoke, and not at his
<i>vis-à-vis</i>. Gregory’s lidless eyes were fixed on
him, however, in their usual direct fashion. “She
is by way of being an ambitious woman.”</p>

<p>“Is she? I have no impression of her beyond
the fact that she was talking rather intelligently to
Churton, on one occasion.”</p>

<p>“When was that?” Halton raised his eyes and
spoke more quickly, still mechanically keeping the
beetle struggling on his back.</p>

<p>“Two days ago, at Mrs. White’s. I didn’t speak
to Mrs. Lewin, but I heard her talk.” He was
unaware of the fact that Mrs. Lewin had been
conscious of him as an audience what time she
quietly drained the O.C.T. for information.</p>

<p>“I think she has brains. She is more attracted
by Key Island than its meagre diversions.”</p>

<p>“Pity the girl isn’t the boy, then!” said the
Administrator cynically. “This thing that sweats
through a morning as my private secretary, and
then with a sigh of relief scrambles into his flannels,
is cursed with the curse of Reuben.”</p>

<p>“Your pet aversion. I think you might be
worse off, myself. Lewin is at least a gentleman—and
his duties include an A.D.C.’s, as well as a
secretary’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Lewin has a pretty wife!” said Gregory bluntly.
“That’s all about it, Halton. I hope the lady will
be so shrewd as to see which side her husband’s
bread is buttered, that’s all. I may get the report
into some form if she makes him work.” He rose
in his usual irrelevant fashion, pushing aside the
last course offered him by the butler, and tossed
over some papers on a side table. “Ambroise had
no news,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“So you need hardly have slipped off to Port
Albert!” retorted Halton. “I’ve an engagement
to-morrow morning, by the way—I shan’t be on
hand to save friction between you and Lewin.”</p>

<p>The Administrator opened his lips as if to say
something; but the under-breathed words did not
come. His hard eyes searched Halton’s reticent
face for a moment with intent, and in his mind
he bore another grudge against his Secretary for
having a wife who could make a fool of a Commissioner.
Taff Halton was a clever man, too.
They had worked together in Central Africa. The
devil take all women!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Lewin,” drawled Halton, “was wearing a
blouse, this afternoon, of a peculiar shade of grey-lavender,
which seemed like a reflection of her
eyes. It’s a pity you don’t study colour effects,
Gregory. You lose so much pleasure.” He knew
just where to plant his sting, for if there was one
thing that Evelyn Gregory loathed it was dilettantism.
Halton’s sleepy eyes saw the curbed
impatience in Gregory’s face, and he dropped back
in his chair so happy that other relaxation was
forgotten; and the hard-back beetle, no longer kept
helplessly clawing the air, crawled away, and
immediately married a lady he discovered in the
shade of a dessert dish. All grades of life are
elementary in Key Island.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I am not making a mistake!”
said Chum to her reflection, as she tied her tie in
severe perfection, and pinned on the Panama hat.
“If I could only get hold of the real man himself,
I am sure I could do something. After all, Mr.
Halton is only the shadow—he will pass as shadows
do, and his influence cannot really push Ally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>She took up her riding-whip slowly, and stood a
minute in thought. It was ten minutes to seven,
and she could afford to arrange her ideas. On the
dressing-table stood the tray with her early coffee,
but Ally must breakfast alone this morning; she
did not expect to get back from China Town till
then. The room was very large and very airy, for
furniture is superfluous in Key Island, and the lack
of it increased the sense of size. The bare boards
were not even polished or stained, and only two
African goat-skins were thrown down as rugs to
break its monotony; there were basket-work chairs
and a lounge from Madeira, and a bed draped with
a mosquito curtain with the usual bridal effect.
The window-frames were many, and were filled
with shutters turned to let in the air, but not the
sun, and there was a door with the same contrivance
in its upper panels. Outside the windows
ran the wide bare stoep carefully clear of creepers,
because vegetation means mosquitoes, which need
no encouragement. Chum fretted over the bareness,
for her hammock was slung there, and she
would have liked to swing in a bower of flame-colour
and rose and greenery, which is to be had
for the asking in the island. But common-sense
was triumphant over sentiment, and the stoep was
comparatively flyless.</p>

<p>Common-sense was just then fighting for the
upper hand in Mrs. Lewin’s mental attitude, and
her pause with the riding-whip idly tapping her
skirt was the result. It was easy, to say nothing
of being pleasant, to go on as she had begun, with
the garrison quite ready to follow in her train, and
the Commissioner to lend it a certain distinction.
But it meant no future good for Ally, and Leoline
Lewin had, without admitting it, begun to see that
if Ally went up the ladder somebody would have
to push him rung by rung.</p>

<p>“Mr. Halton is so much more interesting!” said
inclination.</p>

<p>“The Administrator has the real power!” said
reason.</p>

<p>It was all the harder because in the one case she
knew herself sure of success, and in the other she
saw probable failure—and Mrs. Lewin disliked
failure. Every woman in Key Island had made
tentative efforts to bind Mr. Gregory to her chariot
wheels, and had quietly drawn back without a hint
of her defeat, after the manner of her sex. The
only difference to Mrs. Lewin’s case was that she
really wished to interest Mr. Gregory in her
husband and not in herself; but she could not hope
that this would make her any more successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Besides, he must begin by liking me, and being
interested in me, though he doesn’t know it,” she
said to herself candidly. “And at present he
simply does not know that I exist. Well, perhaps
China Town may prove useful—some day.”</p>

<p>She went across the house to her husband’s dressing-room,
where he had slept in order that her
early rising might not disturb him, and looked in
before starting. Alaric was lying with his arm
thrown up above his head, in a boyish fashion that
made him seem very young in spite of the manliness
of the bronzed dark face, and the thick moustache
on his upper lip. Chum bent down and
ruffled his hair rather fondly, and he sighed in his
sleep and turned over, but did not wake. There
was a shadow of vague yearning in her eyes as she
turned away and went out on to the stoep. Marriage
had touched her lightly, but this was one of
the rare moments when she felt a craving after
something more satisfying—something that might
even be welcome pain if it were only less ephemeral.</p>

<p>The morning air was brisk compared to the general
laxity of Key Island. Mrs. Lewin mounted
the pony which the sais held for her, and rode away
through the listening day, with her senses equally
alert. For it seemed at this hour as if everything
had ears, or a keener vitality that looked for new
experiences. Even Liscarton trod daintily, and
sidled through the gate into the highway, pretending
that he saw bogies among the ragged fans of
the bananas. Where the path dipped down into
Port Victoria the hoofs of a second pony became
audible, and a minute later the Commissioner overtook
her and drew up alongside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“You are before your time, Mrs. Lewin; I meant
to pick you up at your own gate,” he said gaily.
He also seemed in unusual harmony with Nature.
“Isn’t it worth while to rise early and get the spring
of the morning into one’s system? I feel like that
charming person in Scripture who ‘walked delicately,’
though I am afraid he was hardly a model
to copy in his after-history.”</p>

<p>“Agag, wasn’t it?” said Chum. “I always felt
I should have liked to follow his career a little further,
but one never gets a chance. Do you notice
how very badly they tell a story in the Bible?
They have no idea of keeping back the end of the
plot. ‘Now Ahab was fallen sick of the sickness
whereof he died,’ they say, and, of course, as you
know what is coming, it seems superfluous to read
any further.”</p>

<p>“In fact, you don’t care about Ahab unless he is
going to live.”</p>

<p>“I never did care for the pawns in the game who
are sacrificed. It is the big pieces who accomplish
the struggle, whether they do ill or well, who interest
me. I feel that they have made something out
of life, instead of life making something out of
them.”</p>

<p>“And yet there can be no attainment without
self-sacrifice,” said Halton quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>They were riding through the little town, sometimes
in the shadow of the unruly palms, which
waved like banners over the low wooden houses,
sometimes in the new-born sunshine. There were
a few natives about, but no white people. At the
hotel a single disconsolate Chinaman was flapping
a cloth on the stoep, and Mrs. Lewin looked up,
remembering her first night there, and laughed.
Discomforts passed by her easily at present. By-and-by
the ponies began to ascend the further hill
which circles the back of the town by a zigzag
path, and it seemed that the little white houses and
the blue bay fell gradually below them, until they
topped the ridge and drew rein a moment to breathe
their mounts before they began to descend on the
other side of the hill called the Pass. In Africa it
would have been a “Nek,” for it really connected
Maitso and the lower heights of Mitsinjovy, but
Key Island has not caught so much of the Dutch
influence.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid to canter?” Halton said. “Your
pony does not seem blown.”</p>

<p>“He is Captain Nugent’s pony, and you probably
know his capacities better than I. He danced when
I set off, but the hill has sobered him—however,
we can soon see. Come up, Liscarton!”</p>

<p>The game little chestnut stretched his neck to
the loosened rein, and broke into the rocking Key’land
canter. There was a rough, tangled path before
them, and a gradual descent, but the ponies
were used to it and took it with a sober joy. As
the second valley opened before them Mrs. Lewin
saw the draped hills and the patches of liquid yellow-green
that meant cane intermixed with the
darker hemp, and as they rounded a curve of the
track they came suddenly in view of a tiny native
settlement.</p>

<p>The Commissioner drew rein. “I’m not going
to take you absolutely into it,” he said, “but that
is China Town. It is suspected of yellow fever
just now, and a man has died—it is probably only
biliousness though. The doctors are always quarrelling
about the two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>It looked the happiest and most innocent little
spot on earth—far more innocent than Port Victoria,
with its ominous wharves and coaling jetties
for the sea traffic. There was even a little pagoda
to one building, and tiny blue-coated figures were
moving about busily, looking like a new kind of
ant from the distance of the hillside. Most of the
huts were thatched with reed, and the whole village
was little more than a scattered group.</p>

<p>“Do you see that larger house apart from the
others?” said Halton, pointing across the valley.
“That is where Burton, the Town Warden, lives.
He is Gregory’s right-hand man out here, and
watches the place like a sleuth-hound.”</p>

<p>“It seems impossible that anything could be
hidden there!” Mrs. Lewin exclaimed involuntarily.
“Why, there is nowhere to hide it!”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless they very successfully have hidden
their source of murder,” said Halton dryly. “That
large barn-like arrangement is the sugar factory,
but you cannot very well distinguish it from here.
Unless they manage to conceal their evil brew there
it must be done in their own houses.”</p>

<p>“And is it really so serious an evil?”</p>

<p>“It caused the death of some eighty white people,
indirectly. The rioters were mad with drink—with
this hashish—and they rose with a suddenness
no one could foresee, because it was unpremeditated
on their own part. Let a native get drunk on
hashish and he goes out to kill. There were no
regular troops here in the time of the Company,
only a police force officered by men lent by the
War Office, and these gentlemen appear to have
been mostly on leave, shooting in Madagascar.”</p>

<p>“But how were the rioters armed?”</p>

<p>“They broke into the houses and armed themselves.
The favourite weapon was a razor bound
on to a stick, with which they jabbed upwards, but
no kind of knife was despised. The most appalling
thing was when they made a kind of torch out
of the half-worked hemp soaked in oil and set
their victims alight—am I frightening you, Mrs.
Lewin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“No—but I have a very vivid imagination. I
can see it all, and it turns me rather sick. Did the
Chinamen fight too?”</p>

<p>“A few, though the worst offenders were the
half-castes and the Malagasy. The Arab is as
great a coward as the pure native, so that part
of the population were comparatively harmless.
There was a good deal of carnage among the
planters and residents before the police got the
upper hand, and the consequence was that Government
had to step in and take over the island to reduce
it to order.”</p>

<p>“Whence followed a Commissioner to make enquiries,
and Mr. Gregory to teach them a lesson.
Did he teach them, by the way?”</p>

<p>“I believe he did—a slight one,” said Halton
briefly. “I arrived on the scene a week or so
later.”</p>

<p>“I wonder the Government puts power into his
hands, considering that they always seem to have
to censure him afterwards,” said Mrs. Lewin musingly.</p>

<p>“It is rather difficult to ignore a successful man,”
said Halton, “even the British Government find
that. And he has been most uncomfortably successful
on several occasions, though his measures
may have been drastic.”</p>

<p>“I see. You generally come out a week or so
later, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“It is the one boon I wring out of the Colonial
Office; but I am speaking confidentially, Mrs.
Lewin. You happen to know these things because
you are here and in touch with them. At
home they know little, because Mr. Gregory has
quite a prejudice against the Press.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“They might hinder him, but I doubt anything
really stopping his drastic measures, as you call
them.” A memory of the Administrator’s face rose
before her like a revelation—the overhanging brows
and forehead, the savage, lidless eyes, the secretive
mouth, that lurked under the ragged moustache.
Above all, the voice that spoke under his breath
seemed to her ominous. Here was a strong man,
not afraid to do lawless things and call them law by
his own authority. Her blood tingled a little with
the thought. “How they must hate him!” she
said. “How weaker men must long to tie his
hands and make him pay for proving them his inferiors,
in action at least!”</p>

<p>“If we could tax success it would no doubt be a
popular measure with the majority—who have not
succeeded.”</p>

<p>There was a flash of appreciation in Mrs.
Lewin’s eyes, but all she said was, “The lighter
green is the cane, I suppose?” in an irrelevant
tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, but this is a small crop compared to a big
sugar estate—Denver’s, or the Tsara Valley crops,
for instance. There is no considerable hemp-growing
in Key’land, and we wish there was none at all.
There it is at present, however.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>He pointed with his whip, and her eyes followed
and distinguished the two plantations. The hemp
was thinly sown, as it always is for intoxicating purposes,
whereas when honestly cultivated for fibre the
plants are crowded together. It was not yet in
flower, for the sowing was in October or November—the
spring of the Key’land year, the Tsara of
Madagascar. The young plants stood stiffly, and
were branched even to the roots; from the distance
where Mrs. Lewin and Halton had paused it was
just possible to distinguish how far apart the plants
grew, unlike the unbroken sweep of the sugar-cane.
The crop was always sown on higher ground too,
generally on the gentle slope of the further hills,
for hemp does not love a low level. The dark
green of its wide leaves contrasted boldly with the
lighter cane, and made a pleasant patchwork of the
valley.</p>

<p>“They don’t pull the male flowers until January,
and the female a month later,” remarked Halton,
looking across the wicked sexual hemp that flowered
twelve feet high in Hashish Valley, for it liked
the rich soil. “You know, of course, that it has
two genders.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Then it is converted, ostensibly, into ropes, and
food for small birds, and other innocent and useful
things, in that hemp mill down there. Now, Mrs.
Lewin, you are looking at the sugar factory.”</p>

<p>“I am not, indeed; I can see the mill quite
plainly. And I suppose the Chinese really turn it
into hashish?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it is stolen and secretly converted
into bhang or ganja first. I don’t exactly
know what form it takes here, but I’ve seen bhang,
and its results, in India. So has Gregory!” he
added significantly.</p>

<p>“I wonder they are not found out.”</p>

<p>“It is so simple, you see. Bhang is only the
dried leaves and stalks of the hemp, and if you heat
it with water and butter I assure you that you get
quite a surprising result! My own opinion is,
though, that they are yet more diabolical down
there in China Town, and dissolve the resin in
rum; you can use any alcohol for the purpose, but
the rum being at hand they would naturally take
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“And then they dance the <i>carrab</i> dance. I remember
the pictures in the illustrated papers at the
time of the rioting. Ally—I mean Captain Lewin—says
they were quite wrong, but I found them
sufficiently impressive. I should like to be that
man down there, nevertheless—Burton, did you say
his name was?—who is working with Mr. Gregory.
I feel I want to have a hand in it too—to meddle, in
fact. It has its advantages, being a man, though I
seldom see them.”</p>

<p>“I thought that to be a pretty girl was the
height of bliss,” said Halton, with his gentlest insinuation.</p>

<p>“So it is, until you meet with a prettier, perhaps,”
said Chum. There was a flash of mirth in
her eyes, and the deeper drift of the conversation
passed away like the shadow of the clouds over the
sugar-cane.</p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to turn back,” said Halton
regretfully, as the sun’s warmth began to increase to
undoubted heat and glare. “If I bring you home
in the trying part of the day I shall expect to hear
of it from Captain Lewin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Chum had loosened her rein, and Liscarton, with
his lean head stretched out, was cropping an early
breakfast on the hillside. Liscarton was always
hungry—his sais calls it greedy—and the instant his
rein was relaxed, he would wrench it through his
rider’s hands and nose the ground for something to
eat. Mrs. Lewin had already learned that he had a
will of his own that threatened to take the skin off
her fingers did she keep his head up when standing;
and she loved him none the less. She could forgive
wrong-headedness, but she found it very difficult to
forgive docility when it meant laziness. She sat
easily in her saddle, her right hand resting on the
pony’s flank, her body turned that she might look
down on China Town with those musing eyes that
were green and dusk and lavender-grey by turns.
And Alfred Halton watched her with fastidious appreciation,
while by an irony of fate she thought
definitely of the Administrator and his plans, and
the ominous strength that was his attribute. A
man to have as a friend—a power to reach to high
places—yes, decidedly an influence to have for you
rather than against you!</p>

<p>“Have you noticed the names in Key Island?”
said Halton, as they gathered up the reins and rode
their ponies slowly homeward over the Pass.</p>

<p>“No, not particularly, except that I heard Mrs.
Churton say she should go out to Vohitra if it grew
much hotter. Where is Vohitra?”</p>

<p>“Vohitra is our health-resort—it is a big bungalow
up in the hills at the northern part of the
island, some two miles or so from Port Albert.
Vohitra is a badly-chosen name, for it simply means
hill. The place is shut up unless any one wants to
go out there, but sometimes the garrison ladies
make up a house-party, and then I believe it is
pleasant, though there is nothing to do except shoot
fish.”</p>

<p>“How very unsportsmanlike!”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t catch them otherwise. No fly
has ever been found that they will take. Can you
shoot?”</p>

<p>“Yes—though I prefer a revolver to a gun. I
object to a bruised shoulder! What language is
Vohitra?”</p>

<p>“Malagasy. All the names on this side the
island—the Madagascan side—have a flavour of
their giant neighbour, though she is some two hundred
and fifty miles off, except Port Victoria and
Port Albert, which are strictly loyal, you will note.
Maitso means ‘green,’ and Mitsinjovy ‘look out’ or
‘see’; but,” he added, laughing, “the Gunners’
quarters have almost been renamed by White’s little
boy, who calls Mitsinjovy the ‘By-Jovey-Hill!’
and the name has stuck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“How lovely! I do like the way children wrestle
with names they don’t understand, and turn
them into the sense that lies nearest. You said
Vohitra was at Port Albert—I have not been there
yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is rather in the Tsara Valley. There
is another lovely name for you—Tsara, spring o’
the year! And the Volofatsy River that cuts the
valley in two, means the silver river. I wish, for
the sake of euphony, that Key Island had all Malagasy
names; but on the west coast you feel the
influence of Africa, and get Sand Bay, and Africa
Point, and even the Little Zambesi.”</p>

<p>“I like that—there seems some suggestion in it.
But then I am rather inclined to like Key Island.”</p>

<p>“So I am amazed to observe. You will forgive
my wondering if it will last, or if you too will grow
to look on it as a three years’ probation to better
things.”</p>

<p>“And call it a rat-trap, as you did! I dare say
I shall—and yet I cannot imagine it. The place
seems to me too recently dangerous to be dull, and
too possibly important in the near future to be ignored.
And then one can always hope for one of
Mr. Gregory’s drastic measures, and a little excitement!”</p>

<p>“Do let me get home first!” said Halton plaintively.
“You have never seen him through one of
his shindies, and you don’t know how fatiguing it
is. I hope the Government will recall me while I
can plead peace with honour, and give me an armchair
in a quiet corner, from which to contemplate
Gregory burning the hemp-crops seven thousand
comfortable miles away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>For a minute Mrs. Lewin looked a little startled,
but she did not comment on the suggestion, which
was lightly made. Even her ignorance of the popular
feeling and prejudices could not blind her to
the seriousness of such a step as the burning of the
hemp-crops would be, and she wondered if the man
who gave orders under his breath would have the
nerve for such an incredible stroke. She also wondered
why Halton had put such an idea into her
head under the guise of absurd exaggeration, for
she did not believe in his lack of motive.</p>

<p>“I am really very much obliged to you!” she
said frankly, as they shook hands at her own gate.
“You have appeased some of my curiosity, and
given me a delightful ride before the heat.” Her
eyes met the sleepy brown ones that watched her
so covertly. “I can’t, of course, repay you——”</p>

<p>“Unless you will let me plan another like excursion?”</p>

<p>“Will I not?” said Chum gaily. “Only try me!
Good-bye, Mr. Halton—if you see my husband
you might tell him not to be late for luncheon.
There are granadillas and flying-fish, and he loves
both!”</p>

<p>As he rode away Halton thought of the shady
dining-room in the bungalow, the fruit-laden table,
and the wife who thought of her husband’s tastes
and sat opposite to him in the cool sweetness of her
white gowns. No one thought of his tastes, without
irritated supervision, and he found Evelyn Gregory
a poor alternative to the tall girl whose effect
haunted his mind. He did not see her exactly in
detail, as a woman whose inches looked more from
her slight build, and whose hair was a warm brown,
and her eyes as changing as</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“The rare glooms on the far blue hills,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but he said inclusively that she was charming, and
her atmosphere left a blank in his consciousness
when it was removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Note from garrison,” the Administrator said
briefly, tossing it across the luncheon-table as he
sat down. “Mrs. Churton has a function of sorts
next week. Gymkana, or some such foolery, at the
polo-ground—she hopes we will refresh at her
house.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stand that woman!” said Halton, fretted
by a comparison. “She leaves a taste in my mouth
like a cigarette that has gone out.”</p>

<p>“It’s your liver. Who hasn’t a liver in this heat?
My ideal, these days, is a clean tongue and a desire
for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Churton is forty,” pursued Halton spitefully.
“And she aims at three-and-thirty. A
woman of forty is only tolerable as a background
for her daughters!”</p>

<p>The Administrator looked across the space of
white cloth and guavas—there were no granadillas!—with
a grim line about the corners of his hidden
lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“I hope you enjoyed your ride!” he said politely,
with a suggestion of unappreciated humour.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang at eight in the morning,
and if Ally were so disagreeable as to grunt and
turn over on the other side, Chum used to get up
and go to it herself. She was usually aggravated
by the man at Maitso Exchange demanding of her
if she were there, and then no further communication.
He was the Hub of the Port Victorian Universe,
and had become autocratic through bitterness
of spirit; therefore he thought it just retribution to
make sure beforehand that all the usual communication
points were in working order before he
actually had to connect them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>All the gossip of Key Island goes through the
telephone, which is as inappropriate to Port Victoria
as her electric light. It is the alternative for
a post too, for the Planters, living some three miles
out, have no other means of communication, and it
is very much safer to make your own business arrangements
with a fellow at Maitso or Mitsinjovy,
or to order more soda-water from Van Buren’s
Stores, than trust to a letter, even if you are only a
mile from the post-office. When the Lewin Bungalow
was connected, Chum usually found herself
besieged with friendly enquiries as to how she was,
and how Ally Sloper was, and a little conversation
ensued that was as strictly unofficial as all Key’land
characteristics. She only resented it on Sunday,
when English habit still clung to her and made her
feel injured for lack of an extra half-hour in bed,
but as Ally took more rousing than the time spent
at the telephone, it generally ended in Mrs. Lewin
walking into the dining-room bare-foot, yawning
delightfully, and a wasted vision of beauty in <i>déshabille</i>,
since the personality at the other end of the
communication tube was only a voice.</p>

<p>“Well, who are you?” she said sleepily.</p>

<p>“...!”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, Ally’s asleep still—I should say he
was in rude health, unless that suggests a liver!”</p>

<p>“...?”</p>

<p>“Am I ever anything else! And you saw me
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“...!”</p>

<p>“Oh, the day before, was it? I’m sorry I forgot!”</p>

<p>“...”</p>

<p>“If you are sentimental through the telephone, I
shall ring off!”</p>

<p>“...”</p>

<p>“No; really? We hadn’t heard because we
couldn’t go to the Gilderoys.”</p>

<p>“...”</p>

<p>“Oh, they did, did they! People in glass houses
shouldn’t throw stones. Who lost their way back
from the Rano Valley the other night, eh, Captain
Nugent?”</p>

<p>“...?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some one told me—I forget who.”</p>

<p>“...!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true? Well, you needn’t be so tragic
over it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“...?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall come to church like good Christians.
I’m going to ride Liscarton. By the way,
when do you want him back?”</p>

<p>“...”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think pretty speeches are rather
wasted on a married woman?”</p>

<p>“...”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are keeping your hand in!”</p>

<p>“...”</p>

<p>“I can’t listen to any more—I’m too sleepy.
Good-bye!—Ring off, please!”</p>

<p>At breakfast she said, “Ally, we lost a joke by
not going to the Gilderoys. The Denver girl and
Mr. Gurney went into the garden to find a ping-pong
ball, and wandered on to the next door stoep
by mistake (?), and didn’t turn up till midnight.
Can’t you fancy Captain Gilderoy’s state of mind
when he had to go out and look for them with a
lantern?”</p>

<p>“With Mrs. Gilderoy making her brisk little
comments in the background! She has a dangerous
tongue, that woman. Won’t she give a fine
version of the tale all round Maitso! Who told
you, Chum?”</p>

<p>“Brissy—on the ’phone. He said a lot of pretty
things to me too. That’s what you get by leaving
your wife to attend to the thing! I couldn’t really
hear,” she added candidly, “but I could gather that
he simpered, so I laughed too. It’s generally safe
to laugh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“I shall have to cane Brissy one of these days!”
said Alaric, stretching out a shapely hand for the
guava jelly. He had beautiful hands, and Chum
noted them for the hundredth time as he did it.
She always thought that they would have better
suited a doctor than a soldier. “Are we going to
church, Chum?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I promised the Churtons yesterday. They
want us to lunch there. We can ride up after
service, can’t we?”</p>

<p>“If you like. I suppose as it is Sunday there
will be no Bridge—awful bore, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“If you think Sunday will warn Major Churton
off his Bridge, you don’t realise the man. I like the
Major, Ally.”</p>

<p>“He’s a decent chap. His wife’s the better
horse, I expect.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. He looks like a man who
would be any woman’s master. If you notice,
when he says No! even Di Churton can’t say
Yes!”</p>

<p>Ally laughed a little shortly, as if at some checked
reminiscence. He changed the subject too, rather
briefly.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Brissy want his pony back?”</p>

<p>“He said not. I wish you would buy Liscarton,
Ally; I have grown to like him.”</p>

<p>It was part of her adaptability that she could
really earnestly desire the little Key’land pony, and
enjoy his paces, after riding thoroughbred hunters
and hacks that made other riders in the county
envious. Leoline Lewin lived in her present, as
she had said to Halton, and the chestnut pony had
become the simple object of her equestrian ambition
out in Key Island.</p>

<p>“There are lots better ponies,” said Ally.</p>

<p>“Never mind! I like Liscarton.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Brissy would sell.”</p>

<p>“He’s very good-natured,” said Chum adroitly.
She made no reference to the probable influence of
her own wishes upon Captain Nugent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Well—I’ll see.” Ally rose and stretched himself,
walking off to his dressing-room with shoulders
square, while Chum admired him as usual. He
came out later immaculate in white breeches and
linen coat, and seriously considered the problem
as to whether he should wear a Panama hat or a
white helmet, until his wife decided in favour of the
Panama.</p>

<p>“I don’t like helmets out of uniform,” she said,
looking over his shoulder at his good looks reflected
in a hanging glass, with kindly pride. “And you
are just as smart in the straw. Don’t titivate any
more, old fellow, or I shall think it is for Di Churton,
and have to make a dead set for the Major to
balance things.”</p>

<p>Ally laughed a little self-consciously. There was
more in Chum’s speech than she knew—more than
had been said at present. When the male animal
is being flattered with attentions from the female, he
may not glance at her with half an eye; but he begins
to plume himself. Alaric glanced appreciatively
at his wife’s figure as Liscarton carried her to
church by his side, and thought vaguely that she
was a heap better looking than any other woman
out there, and that they made rather a handsome
couple. Then he thought that Chum reflected
credit on his own taste, and then he remembered
with some very private satisfaction that Di Churton
had made a determined show of preference for him
from the first. He did not really admire Mrs. Churton,
save that he could recognize the swing of her
own self-assertion in her position; he never thought
of comparing her with Leoline in a single detail.
But Alaric Lewin was as easily flattered as a child,
and singularly manageable for a really handsome
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>The English church at Port Victoria stands a
little above the town, towards Maitso. It is singularly
like an enormous caravan, with six stumpy
legs in place of wheels, and worshippers go up a
flight of wooden steps to reach its barn-like interior.
Most buildings in Key Island are raised above the
ground for fear of snakes, but the church and the
native huts have wooden props rather than a solid
foundation. There being no church at Maitso, or
as yet at Mitsinjovy, the men were marched down
to service by aggrieved and sweating subalterns,
or a senior officer, and given as much room as could
be spared from the civilians. Truth to tell, the
military force had to take it in turns to be religious,
service being held in barracks, by the chaplain, for
the Wessex, when the Gunners came down to Port
Victoria, and <i>vice versâ</i>. On this particular Sunday
Captain Nugent and Mr. Gurney were bucketing
their men into the pews when the Lewins rode up
to the churchyard. Their sais had preceded them
and took the ponies, hitching them up to the railings
in the shade with native indifference, and dropping
lazily on the grass to slumber away service
time. Chum walked up the steps and into church
in the wake of the soldiers, and sat down in her
seat, drawing her habit round her and feeling the
whole thing horribly unreal. Through the wide
flung shutters she could see palm-trees waving
tuftily in a splash of blue sky, and a gorgeous hibiscus
had thrust a flame of blossom in at one aperture
which was seldom closed. There was nothing
to prevent the flowers coming to church, or the wild
green things outside either, for the only glass in the
place was the East window—a horrid picture of the
Ascension, so quaintly designed that the figure of
the Christ was cut off at the waist, the feet in red
slippers hanging down into the picture, the rest of
the body out of sight. Chum was always fascinated
by that window, for she hated it, and the astonished
faces of the kneeling apostles made her want to
laugh. No wonder they looked as if they wondered
where the rest of the centre figure was gone to—and
yet she had an educated horror of irreverence.
Service, with the thermometer at 90° in the shade,
however, was not at best a success. The soldiers
fidgeted, and stared out of window at the palms,
and Brissy Nugent pulled fretfully at his black
moustache to keep himself awake. When the
mumbling old rector concluded his sermon and the
final hymn was given out, every one rose with relief,
and high above the defective choir rose the
voice of Hamilton Gurney, who was senior sub. of
the Wessex, but was more remarkable for a tenor
voice of unusual compass and power.</p>

<p class="noindent">droned the organ; but Gurney’s voice, rising into
the hot rafters of the church, seemed the only real
religion of the whole ceremony.</p>

<p>“I wish I could have gone to sleep, as you did,
Ally,” said Mrs. Lewin, with frank regret, as they
came out into the sunshine again. “I should have
felt that it had done me so much more good if
I had.”</p>

<p>“Great Scot! the difficulty is <i>not</i> to go to sleep,
when that old boy is meandering round about the
Chronicles! It would be as much as Lysle’s head
was worth if he preached more than ten minutes.
But he’s a jolly good sort.”</p>

<p>“That’s that round-faced man who is regimental
chaplain,” mused Chum. “He always puts me in
mind of a cherub out for a holiday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>The Churtons joined them in the church porch,
Diana in a holland habit and white helmet, as near
to khaki as might be. She annexed Ally with the
boldness of a woman accustomed to stalk her game
in the open, and Mrs. Lewin turned to the Major to
mount her, in no wise disturbed. They sat on their
ponies for a minute to allow the men to pass, before
turning to the bridle path that made a short cut to
Maitso, and as the Wessex swung past her, Chum
looked along the road taken by the moving helmets,
and saw a solitary horseman stopped in like
manner to themselves.</p>

<p>“Gregory’s Powder!” said Diana over her shoulder
to those behind her.</p>

<p>Besides the Churtons’ and the Lewins’ ponies,
the road was blocked by Captain and Mrs. Gilderoy,
an open cart belonging to the Denver girl, and
several other people and their modes of conveyance.
As he came full into a group that he knew,
the Administrator per force stopped and touched
his helmet to the party. He looked more at his
ease in the saddle than in correct cloth at some
Key’land function, as Mrs. Lewin had hitherto met
him, though he rode with a loose-limbed carelessness
that contrasted with the firm seats and carriage
of the army men.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Gregory? Have you been
to church in the open air?” Di Churton called
across the last of the retreating khaki figures.</p>

<p>“I do not go to church, except officially,” said
the Administrator, without any softening of the
assertion. “It is getting hot for ladies to be in the
saddle, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you should order the services earlier,”
retorted Mrs. Churton. “I suppose your authority
might do something even in that particular—officially!
We are taking possession of your
Secretary and Mrs. Lewin, who are coming up to
lunch with us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Something crossed the Administrator’s face—a
gleam of satiric memory to which Chum had not
the key. But as his eyes met hers, and he saluted
again, she tried to hold them with an impersonal
effort that had become habit to her.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Halton this morning?” was what
she happened to say with a little smile, and she left
her face, and her figure which was so at ease with
her pony, to do the rest.</p>

<p>The gleam in Gregory’s eyes became a silent
laugh. “I don’t know—I thought he was going to
church,” he said drily; and then he made a passing
remark to Miss Denver and Mrs. Gilderoy, and rode
away as if he had done his duty.</p>

<p>“Tarred us all with the same brush—a sentence
a-piece,” said Mrs. Churton, with a loud laugh.
“Come along, all of you; the sun is going to be
piping up the hill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>She reined in her pony for an instant to allow
Captain Lewin to come abreast with her, and they
began to climb up through the hill plantations of
guava and palm and mango, the flickering of the
light and shade touching the white riders and the
dark ponies as they passed. Ally looked young
this morning in his cool linen, and Diana Churton
approved of youth. She was more than usually
appropriative in her manner, having reached that
stage when, like a good cricketer, she had got
“set,” and could trust to her attack. Behind them
rode Captain and Mrs. Gilderoy, who were also
lunching at the quarters of the O.C.T., and who had
a devoted fashion of always riding with each other
in public. Captain Gilderoy was Garrison Adjutant,
and Mrs. Lewin had never met him at any social
function, for he made his work an excuse to evade
the monotonous round he hated. His wife used to
say that she had worn out all excuses for his non-presence,
and now told the truth—he simply would
not accompany her. Nevertheless, he knew the
life of the whole station, and commented upon it
with a freedom and bitterness which his hearers
hardly realised on account of a very charming manner.
He could say ill-natured things in a deep
sweet voice, that slipped such poison into a hearer’s
mind without any disagreeable taste at the moment;
but his rasping criticisms had made him the best-feared
man in the garrison. His wife added the
grace of wit to her own backbiting, and had a way
of wrinkling up her face until her eyes were two
dancing slits, while she turned a harmless incident
into a dangerously good story. Together they had
laughed away the reputations of half their acquaintance,
yet it was difficult to locate their mischief
through the light chatter that carried it.</p>

<p>Captain Gilderoy had struck Mrs. Lewin at first
sight as an ugly man, but his voice was so free from
malice, that when she heard him speak she thought
she liked him. It was an impression she never
wholly lost, only when he smiled he reminded her
of a snarling dog, and it put her as instinctively on
her guard as the actual animal would have done.
His wife was one of the few garrison ladies who
were on friendly terms with Diana Churton, partly
because they clashed in no particular, and partly
because it was Mrs. Gilderoy’s policy not to quarrel.
She was an unobtrusive little person to look at,
with a quick manner, and a trick of saying apt
things that Diana vaguely realised was attractive to
men, and valued accordingly. She only priced
women’s gifts by their effect on the opposite sex,
and though Mrs. Gilderoy had no flesh and blood
pretensions, she had an odd attractiveness that increased
with her acquaintance. Mrs. Lewin had
felt this already, in the few times they had met, and
was honestly glad that she was also lunching at the
Churtons’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The rear of the party was the Officer in Command
of the Troops and Chum herself; but she
rode with the bitterness of defeat upon her, so that
she was less conscious than usual of her companion.
Major Churton, for his part, was honestly admiring
the beautiful curve of her figure from shoulder to
waist, and the lift at the corners of her lips. He
had found out already that Mrs. Lewin was easy to
laugh with, and she answered the rein of his fancy
as perfectly as a horse with a good mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The air grew perceptibly fresher as they rose, but
the climb was steep, and both horses and riders bore
signs of the heat when they pulled up before the
Churtons’ quarters. Two or three servants appeared
with noiseless swiftness to take the ponies, but
Major Churton himself lifted Chum out of her saddle
as easily as if she were a child. He was a man
who loved his own strength. The party went on to
the stoep, and the men promptly augmented their
racing blood with stimulant, after the fashion of
Englishmen. There is a particular drink in Key
Island which is called Cého,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> and which is taken
before or after meals, as the fancy prescribes. It is
not therefore the cocktail of the West Indies, nor is
it the “Whiskey-up” of Africa, or the highball of
America, or the universally styled “Drink” of
England, which ranges from simple beer to the last
frenzy of liqueur. Cého is compounded of many ingredients,
but the old seasoned rum of the island is
its foundation, and strange juices from tropic plants
go to make it an evil thing. It is always iced, and
generally precedes a whiskey and soda, which it
demands by reason of a tickled throat; but some
men, and these are hardened Planters, can take three
or four céhos running in preference to longer liqueur,
and do not die—at once.</p>

<p>Ally and Captain Gilderoy took céhos, and
Major Churton a whiskey and soda, in which his
wife followed suit. Mrs. Gilderoy declined and
was overruled, and Mrs. Lewin rose and poured
out the last of the soda-water for herself without
adulteration.</p>

<p>“Do you really like it alone?” said Mrs. Gilderoy,
looking up at the tall figure. “Take care,
Chum! my husband will jog your elbow.—Oh, I
am so sorry!” she broke off lightly. “But it comes
so naturally to call you that. It somehow suits you.”</p>

<p>“Do, if you like,” said Mrs. Lewin good-humouredly.
“I expect we shall all fall into the Christian-name
stage eventually, so why not at once? I am
sure you all call my husband Ally Sloper—it is so
appropriate!”</p>

<p>Every one glanced at Ally, tall and strong and
triumphantly good to look upon, and there was a
general laugh.</p>

<p>“Ah, but Chum isn’t your name, and I know
Captain Lewin calls you so!” said Mrs. Gilderoy,
with faint suggestion in her tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, from nursery days. Ally never has called
me anything else but Chum, because it amply defined
the position. I don’t mind other people using
it a bit.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilderoy half closed her eyes, and looked
up with a glitter of laughter in them. “When you
talk like that it sounds as if you had married your
brother!” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Lewin’s smooth fair cheeks did not even
flush. She was chattering with Major Churton over
a gymkana next week, and a pony which she was to
name.</p>

<p>“I think I shall call it ‘Key’land Gloom’!” she
said. “It expresses the mind of all the officials
here so well. I have hardly heard any one speak
well of the place since I arrived.”</p>

<p>“Beastly hole!” said Di Churton loudly. “I
wish they had sent Bute to the West Coast,
rather.”</p>

<p>“But that is a fever station!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s better pay and better leave. I
shouldn’t mind Sierra Leone for a bit—a good
many women have gone out.”</p>

<p>“I expect that will be my next job!” said
Churton carelessly, as he set down his empty glass.
“It’s Paradise to this, anyway!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk of this! I hate Key Island, and
everything in it. Have a whiskey, Ally Sloper?”
Di smiled at Mrs. Lewin to introduce the nickname
in public. Next time she would not take the
trouble, while further off still she would say Ally
without reserve.</p>

<p>“Better not, Ally!” said Chum, laughing. “I
shall have to carry you home if you begin so
early.”</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of cého!” said Captain Lewin
apologetically, as he filled another tumbler. “I
say, Chum, what a sweet sight for the Administrator
if he met us tottering home arm in arm!”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself! I’ve had soda.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the day is yet young!” said Major Churton.
“You may yet catch him up before tea, Mrs.
Lewin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The whiskey and soda was finished, and Ally’s
throat asked for another by the time that luncheon
was on the table. It was a light meal, lightly
relished, in a room that had more doors and windows
than walls, and of which the heavy scented
flowers and the strange fruits seemed as inevitably
a part as the iced drinks. Chum had put Mr.
Gregory on one side, and was talking to Major
Churton consciously. He was a man who had
been far and done hard things in strange lands,
and she read the lines of it in his face, from the
great square forehead to the self-reliant chin. It
was not by any means a Sir Galahad type of face—Tristram
or Lancelot’s failings were more likely
branded there; but it was a soldier’s face for all
that, and, despite the grey on his thick, clipped
head, he looked what she had called him—a man
who would be any woman’s master. Strength
attracted Mrs. Lewin in whatever form she met
with it; she ignored the talk at the other end of
the table, which had drifted inevitably to stamps,
and gave her attention to her host.</p>

<p>“I am bent on mastering the intricacies of the
sugar industry,” she confided to him, while behind
her shoulder she could hear Ally comparing the
many different shades of the Grenada and Barbadoes
star watermarked issues with Captain Gilderoy.
“Is there a factory within my reach?”</p>

<p>“Denver’s is the best. You know Denver, don’t
you? He was a great man in the old Company’s
day, and is still on the Legislator. He has the
largest plantation this side the Pass, and it joins
your ground on one side. You ought to go over
his factory, if you are really interested in native
industries.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why you all find that so hard to
understand? Ever since I arrived I have been
met on all sides with weeping and lamentation, and
because I do not join in it I am counted a fraud.
Key Island seems a very possible centre of interest
to me for the three years that one is stationed
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Wait till you have done your three years!”
said Bute Churton, as he handed her a cigarette.
“I have had twenty years’ foreign service, Mrs.
Lewin, and I never wish to see a palm-tree again
once I get quit of this. Give me solid English
comfort!”</p>

<p>“Most people’s idea of solid English comfort,
and ‘Home, sweet home,’ consists in early Victorian
furniture and all the meals an hour later on
Sunday!” said Chum. “It gives me indigestion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that is the ‘Home, sweet home’ of one’s
relations and old family friends—the sort of people
that one only thinks about at Christmas and on
their birthdays, in fact.”</p>

<p>“No!” said Chum, firmly; “I never remember
people’s birthdays on principle. Sooner or later it
is bound to degenerate into rudeness.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me that there is a birthday
dinner party threatening us next week, anyhow.
Old Arthur White met me in the club and told me
he was sixty next Thursday. They have a feed on
at the Harrac. Are you going?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so. Mr. Halton tells me that
Harrac is one of the few houses where they know
how to cook flying-fish, and you can trust to the
Bridge being sound.”</p>

<p>“‘Bridge’ is not my game, though I play it,”
said the Major, with unconscious self-revelation.
“I like ‘Poker’—one is on one’s own there. I
prefer to trust to myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Chum looked at his line of chin and forehead,
and smiled. For a minute she wondered what it
would be like to have a husband who preferred to
trust to himself. Ally so infinitely preferred to
leave the final decision to her! It sounded rather
restful, and she glanced round half curiously at the
man with whom she had linked her own fate—and
power of making up her mind—to find him seriously
arguing with Captain Gilderoy that the Saint Lucia
twopence halfpenny crown C. C. would rise in the
market now that Queen’s heads were becoming
scarce. It seemed he could really concentrate his
thoughts and energies on a hobby, anyway. She
caught the beautiful curve of his earnest face with
simple artistic pleasure, and then found Mrs.
Churton waiting to make a move from the table.</p>

<p>“Have you finished your smoke, Chum?” she
said carelessly as she rose. “Come into my room
and freshen up. The men are good for more
whiskey yet.”</p>

<p>“I hope not!” said Chum, with a half-resigned,
half-protesting glance at Ally, which slid harmlessly
over his bent head and was lost among the
shades of the Canadian two-cent map stamp.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I hear you talking about Denvers?”
said Mrs. Gilderoy, as the three women entered
Mrs. Churton’s room and drifted by mutual attraction
towards the looking-glass. “You heard how
Trixie Denver behaved at our house the other
night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Brissy—Captain Nugent—told me this
morning through the telephone.” She thought of
Ally’s prophecy, that Mrs. Gilderoy would make a
story out of the incident, and waited with a smile
somewhere hidden in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, we had an awful time! My good
man took a lantern and went to find them at last,
for they had been out there simply hours! I told
him he had better be careful how he turned it on—it
was one of those electric things, you know.
But he flashed it straight into the dark corners, and
discovered them, to the mutual embarrassment of
all three!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“If some one doesn’t look after that girl she’ll
come to grief!” said Mrs. Churton scornfully.
“Since she has taken up with the Clayton woman
she has been nothing but a camp follower.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mrs. Clayton?” said Chum, with some
curiosity, but more of a desire to shift the talk from
a girl’s name. She did not care for Miss Denver,
who offended her taste and vision alike; but Diana’s
comments were nearly as jarring.</p>

<p>“They are A.S.C. people—they have quarters
at Mitsinjovy. She’s the woman who was at Mrs.
White’s the other night in green. You could not
have missed seeing her!”</p>

<p>“But I was not there. Does she dress so
oddly?”</p>

<p>“She has one garment that every one speculates
over. I fancy it began life as a nightgown, but she
always wears it on unofficial evenings!”</p>

<p>“Be charitable, and put it down to the heat!
Ally would live in pyjamas, if I would let him.
What is Mrs. Clayton’s garment like? Perhaps
I might adapt my own nightdresses—with a
sash!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Gilderoy thoughtfully, “I don’t
quite know how to describe it—do you, Di? But
if a bathing dress had a—a flirtation with a kimono,
Eva Clayton’s garment might be the result! I can’t
see how it would be obtained otherwise. It is certainly
a hybrid!”</p>

<p>Her eyes became mere slits of laughter, and Mrs.
Lewin laughed too, with soft, full enjoyment.</p>

<p>“I shall look out for Mrs. Clayton,” said she.
“She is out at By-Jovey, is she? I love that name
for the Gunners’ Hill!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Trixie Denver goes over there half her
time, and she and Mrs. Clayton sit on the steps of
the Gunnery,—on the men’s knees, I believe, as
soon as it gets dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder they wait for that!” said Diana
scornfully. “What did Captain Gilderoy find
Gurney doing with Trixie?”</p>

<p>“They were on the Jacksons’ stoep—their quarters
join ours, you know. Wray says that Trixie
was draped round Gurney’s neck, and he looked a
perfect fool. We were furious, of course, as the girl
was dining at our house, and in our care for the
time, at least. Wray spoke to Gurney pretty
plainly, and told him that unless he meant to marry
her, he had better behave decently when she was
with us.”</p>

<p>“It is her fault, not Gurney’s,” asserted Diana,
sacrificing the woman to the man with the instinct
of her class. For she was a “man’s woman,” and
would see no wrong in the sex. “What did he
say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wriggled out of it—said he couldn’t
afford to marry. It is rather a pity for the girl,
don’t you think?” Her eyes glanced at Chum in
the looking-glass, where she was powdering her face.
Mrs. Lewin stood behind her, her taller stature enabling
her to see over the little woman’s head, while
she watched a trifle satirically to see Mrs. Gilderoy
wet her finger with her lips and draw it across her
lashes.</p>

<p>“Wretchedly large puffs you have, Di!” she said
calmly. “One’s eyes always catch the powder and
give it away.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a thing I use at all,” Di Churton
boasted, passing her handkerchief over her burnt
and oozing skin. “How are you getting on with
your housekeeping, Chum? I forgot to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Very well, thanks to Abdallah. I must confess
he does more towards it than I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve got Abdallah? I hate Arabs myself.
We’ve Malagasy and natives. Your servants
sleep on the stoep, of course?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Chum, laughing. “It’s
their own fault if they do. There are servants’
quarters.”</p>

<p>“I bet you five to one they sleep on the stoep,
and bring their women there too!”</p>

<p>“That goes without saying,” said Mrs. Gilderoy,
relinquishing the powder puff for a manicure case.
Whatever were Diana Churton’s other drawbacks
her hands were always immaculate. “When we
had Arabs I never could go out after the house was
shut up, or I fell over them on the doorstep, and—and
it embarrassed me!”</p>

<p>“Brutes!” said Chum disgustedly. Her eyes
grew stormy, and a beautiful red colour came into
her cheeks, that were usually rather pale. “I will
turn them out one and all, if that is the case.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a fool!” said Mrs. Churton scornfully.
“If they are good servants, keep them.
What on earth does it matter what they do? All
the coloured people are alike—only animals.”</p>

<p>She did not see that her broad judgment might
apply to white races also, though later she went
back to the stoep and her contemplation of Alaric
Lewin. There was a certain grave dark beauty in
Ally’s face which was deceptive, because at the
moment he was merely rather sleepy; but when the
Lewins mounted their ponies again for the ride
home in the short twilight, Mrs. Churton strolled
over to Ally and laid her hand on the neck of his
mount.</p>

<p>“If you can come up some time with your duplicates
I’ll make a fair exchange with you, for some
of those Sydney Views you have,” she said. Stamps
are an innocent and mutual hobby. Mrs. Lewin did
not collect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully!” said Ally. The last whiskey
that had been pressed on him at parting made him
feel that Di Churton was really a good sort of pal to
have, and he moved the reins.... Di’s hands
were cool and soft to touch.</p>

<p>“Ally, I’m half-way home!” called Chum,
laughing, as she steered Liscarton down the steep
road.</p>

<p>The man gathered up his reins and rode after his
wife, his hand delicately conscious of a soft touch
still.</p>

<p>The woman turned back to the house, wondering
if any one had seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Nobody thought of the Arabs on the stoep—but
even such courtship as theirs must have a beginning.</p>

<p>It is not exactly good for any man to be a condensed
force in his own person. An administrator
represents a governor, who in his turn represents
the Imperial Government and takes precedence of
any stray royalty who may drift into his kingdom—provided
he is not the <a id="figgerhead">figgerhead</a> itself. A representative
power is very demoralising, because the reins of
government are too concentrated—in spite of the
Legislative Council. Six or seven thousand miles
away is Westminster, and somebody who is called
the Colonial Secretary, and who can write letters
with censure in them; but on the spot, in such rat-traps
as Key Island, for instance, is an administrator,
and this unit is for the nonce a king in his own
country if he has the confidence of the men over
him. The effect of this is seen when such transitory
monarchs go home, and walk into the Colonial
Office to demand an extra six months’ leave. Then
they learn their real importance, which is so great
that they cannot be spared, and are sent back to
their tiny kingdoms not at all appreciative of the
compliment that has been paid them. A small corner
of the British Empire is the very worst school
in which to learn a sense of proportion; but Evelyn
Gregory had been put in power in many of such
corners, and had learned to see things from a proper
distance even while he lived in the midst of them.
It was the more surprising, therefore, that he always
impregnated himself with his kingdom of the
moment, and that particular spot (whether it were
many thousand square miles in the centre of Africa
or Northern India, or only the limited area of Key
Island) was the problem which absorbed all his
faculties until he had made himself its master. The
raging energies of the man demanded an object on
which to expend themselves in such a way, and had
been his quality of success throughout his turbulent
career. It was a little hard on Alaric Lewin, who
was cast in another mould, that he should have been
appointed under a man who was a glutton for work,
and suffer as an ineffectual tool. But the Colonial
Office is no respecter of individualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>There was a meeting of the Executive Council on
the morning of the Arthur Whites’ dinner; it was a
small body, consisting of the Attorney-General himself,
Bute Churton as officer in command of the
forces, and the Colonial Treasurer, besides the
Administrator. Gregory mounted his pony and
rode down into town thinking of his plans and the
future of Key Island, rather than of any social
function, though he was to be one of the guests at
the Harrac. He was not a dreamer, but his restless
brains built fortresses where other men’s built castles
in the air, and he projected schemes for the Empire
in place of personal ambitions. The little streets
opened out before him and revealed the ring of the
bay and the two great rocks guarding the harbour
entrance, and the Administrator’s keen sleepless
eyes stared out through them as a lion’s through the
bars of his cage. With the smell of the sunshine
and the tropic life in his nostrils he jogged easily
along, mechanically raising his hand to his helmet
if any one saluted him, but seeing more of the sandbox
and eucalyptus trees in the little central square
where the band played, than of the people he
passed.</p>

<p>If France developed the resources of Madagascar
now, as this new interest in the Hovas seemed to
indicate, that meant a spur in her trade, and more
traffic with Africa. Nothing would have pleased
Evelyn Gregory more than the least excuse for a
quarrel if only he could have laid greedy hands
on a portion of his huge neighbour. He knew
Madagascar and her capabilities,—he held theories
about the ore that he chafed to see neglected,—and
he coveted her for his Government, who
already found Key Island more trouble than she
was worth. To turn his guns on the French ships
as they came up the Channel, and be the base of
British operations with the safe harbour and huge
coaling stations, would have fed his fighting instincts
and ambitions alike. He glanced at Tsofotra,
the left gate and the more accessible of the
two, where the guns could be dragged up somehow
in case of hard necessity; and he felt a secret
attraction towards those great sentinels, rising bare
and grim to over two thousand feet above his
harbour.</p>

<p>... A woman passed him, riding up towards
Government House, the way he had come. He
forgot the Lewins’ bungalow for the minute, and
half-wondered where she was going. She bowed,
and he saluted, before he remembered that she was
Mrs. Lewin, the pretty wife of his incapable A.D.C.,
who had better have been the boy than the girl.
But her face only brought a memory of her husband
to his mind, and made his harsh features a trifle less
ingratiating than usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Why on earth had they sent him such a show
article as Lewin for the work he had before him!
He wanted brains and energies, not muscles and
trained animal courage—a man, not only a soldier.
Gregory knew that as yet he had not his administration
in the iron grip in which he would hold it
by-and-by, and before casting a loving eye round
the Channel,—Madagascar on one side, and Mozambique
on the other,—he must make Key Island his
own. The natives were cowed with the presence
of the troops, but the root of the mischief was there
still, and he had not yet probed down to it. He
wanted certain things done, too, by the Home
Government—the factories encouraged and enlarged,
for he knew the value of sweating the devil
out of his people, and minor industries, such as
timber growing, given a helping hand; there were
memoranda to make, reports to send back to England,
a mass of clerical work to get through before
Halton was recalled,—and Captain Lewin was the
best polo player that the club could get on to their
faulty ground, and in constant demand for tennis
and gymkana. Truly the fates were unpropitious
for both men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Chum had ridden on in the sunshine, thinking as
hard as Gregory. He would be at the Arthur
Whites’ to-night, and he would talk of tennis and
cricket matches to the best of his ability to the
woman assigned him for dinner party, probably
playing the part of courteous listener, if only she
would do the talking—Mrs. Lewin was beginning
to know his methods; and then, once the ladies had
gone, he would draw nearer to the man who could
really interest him, and talk of the island and the
life there that woke him to more than surface
attention,—but that man would not be Ally! No
schooling would push Ally into the place she
wanted him to take after her back was turned, and
she herself was helpless. With feminine philosophy
she dressed carefully that night, not for the Administrator,
but because Chum never despised the
advantage of facing the world fortified by being
perfectly turned out. She was more successful than
usual over her unruly hair, and the pretty ripples lay
round her flat ears—not over them, for Ally’s warning!—and
were massed down into the nape of her
neck as if they loved her, and were glad to frame
her beauty. She looked at the slope of her neck
and the warm, white round of her shoulder, and
because she was respectful of her Creator’s work,
she fastened a big, black velvet rose to the shoulder-strap,
where its artificial duskiness kissed the reality
of her own seductive dimples. More than one man
found himself vaguely conscious of that false flower
before the dinner was over, and thought stealthily
of Captain Lewin’s domestic bliss. Leoline was
not exactly a woman whose influence was towards
goodness, whatever she might be in herself. For
though she had no vice of her own, she suggested
all of them in turn to coarser and more masculine
minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>The Arthur Whites had placed their table well,
and this is a great gift in Key Island, where guests
are easily bored through constantly meeting each
other. The host and hostess did not sit at either
end of their square table, but because one side
would accommodate almost as many as another they
had a way of disposing themselves among their
guests, and placing two instead of one at either end.
It broke the usual solemn monotony of dinners,
and accommodated a larger number. Thus it happened
that Mrs. Lewin, who had been taken in by
Captain Gilderoy, found that she was next the end
of the table where her host should ordinarily have
sat, but round the corner were the Administrator
and Mrs. White. To sit next to Mr. Gregory was
nothing, for what attention he had to give was Mrs.
White’s. Chum smiled upon the garrison adjutant,
and enjoyed herself with a continuation of the
philosophy that had dressed her for conquest.
Across the table she could see a woman, who was a
stranger to her, neglecting her rightful partner,
Major Churton, and talking at the Administrator
through the medium of a projected water scheme
in which she was not really interested, and noted her
failure with as much sympathy as amusement.
After all, they had all had their water-scheme trial,
and failed also!</p>

<p>“Who is Major Churton’s partner?” she said
idly to Gilderoy, under the buzz of the conversation
round them.</p>

<p>“That is Mrs. Clayton of Mitsinjovy fame!” he
answered. “They have only been out a month or
so longer than you, and she was ill with fever at
first, so it took some time for her questionable attractions
to dawn on us.”</p>

<p>(“Then she does not know Mr. Gregory, and
that is why she is wasting her energies on the water
scheme!” thought Chum.) Aloud she said cautiously,
“Do you know her?”</p>

<p>“Not personally, I am thankful to say, but I have
a smiling acquaintance with her. I have to pass
their house on my way down to town and to the
garrison office every morning, and she is generally
showing her ankles for my benefit on the stoep. I
always smile, because as she has taken the trouble
to get into her hammock, presumably on my account,
it would be unkind not to do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin looked at his rather rugged face, and
found it curiously deceptive. For his eyes were
quite friendly, and when he spoke in that pleasant
tone it was difficult to realise his sneering insinuations
about the lady sitting opposite, who was even
now casting glances in his direction.</p>

<p>“What sort of acquaintance did you say you
had?” she asked, laughing.</p>

<p>“Just a smiling one. Don’t you know that
stage? I should say it was very inadvisable to go
further and fare worse with the O.C.T.’s dinner
partner!”</p>

<p>“Now I come to think of it I have had that degree
of intimacy with people myself. It is rather
fascinating, because though one can’t bow it is not
in human nature not to recognise a familiar face in
some way that evades the social law. But why
should you judge Mrs. Clayton by her ankles?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and the dog-smile
marred his face for a moment. “If a woman gives
me such a flagrant invitation, what am I to think?
They have not begun entertaining yet, but if you
would rather wait and judge them by their tennis-cake
and Bridge-markers pray do so. For me, I
have my private opinion.”</p>

<p>“Is that the usual test out here—how one entertains?
I am still on my probation then, because
we have no courts, and have not started Bridge.
Ally and I only give whiskey-and-soda dinners at
present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Well, that is excellent, or sounds so!” he retorted,
turning to look at her more closely. Captain
Gilderoy always retained his air of being a
gentleman whatever he said or did, but he was also,
at times, a man—the black rose that Chum was
wearing was on his side, not the Administrator’s,
and he was well content with his lot, so much so
that when Diana Churton loudly claimed his attention
to pronounce judgment on a short issue of
Victorian stamps, he turned reluctantly to answer,
leaving Mrs. Lewin for the moment unmonopolised.</p>

<p>The dinner was practically over, but there was
just that pause of desultory talk before Mrs. White
rose that kept the men from their cigarettes—in
this house the women were, officially, not supposed
to smoke—and Chum knew that her hostess would
look at her in a minute, and altered her attitude to
one of more alertness; but she had a school-girl
trick of slipping off her shoes under the dinner-table,
and for the minute the little right-hand slipper
was missing.</p>

<p>She was feeling about for it with a distressed silk
foot, when an inspiration flashed into her head, filling
her eyes with brilliant laughter. The Administrator
was not at the moment occupied any more
than herself; he was leaning back in his chair, his
eyes for once cast down, his massive face inwardly
absorbed, but one nervous hand playing with the
fruit knife betraying the active, working brain.
Mrs. Lewin looked at him ... were they all
wrong? Had Mrs. Clayton and the water scheme
failed to arrest his attention for exactly the same
reason that her own tentative efforts had not succeeded—that
they had all appealed to the wrong
side of the man? How would audacity do instead?...</p>

<p>She leaned forward, her face flushed with her own
uncertain daring, her eyes still full of laughter, half
excited, half amused at the experiment, and spoke
hurriedly under her breath.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gregory, will you try and find my shoe for
me?”</p>

<p>The hand that played with the fruit knife stopped
as if by clockwork, and the Administrator raised
his hard eyes and looked full into hers in his amazement.
A half-smile softened his own lips in answer
to her apologetic dimples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Lewin?”</p>

<p>“My shoe!” said Chum with apparent impatience.
“I have a foolish habit of slipping them
off at meals and I’ve lost one, and Mrs. White
will look at me and rise in a minute, and I can’t
go. Do feel for it! It must be somewhere near
you.”</p>

<p>His face flushed dark red with suppressed laughter,
as, more awake to the situation than she had
ever known him, he sat back and felt cautiously
about in the unseen space of floor. A minute later
he had really found it, and caught it between his
feet. The little soft satin thing felt utterly alien and
feminine, and yielded to the pressure of his feet,
yet just because it was so empty it suggested to his
senses the foot that would fill it. He pushed it
carefully towards Mrs. Lewin, his eyes still fixed
upon her.</p>

<p>“Have you found it?” she said eagerly, without
a trace of consciousness in her charming face.
“Thank you so much!... Yes, I have
it!... That’s all right!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>He had inevitably touched the little unslippered
foot in its silk stocking, but she did not seem to be
aware of the fact as he was. Mrs. White had risen,
and Mrs. Lewin rose too, with one brilliant smile
of thanks at him—nothing more. The Administrator
was nearest to the door; he got out of his
seat and held it for the ladies, looking down on
them from his unusual height as they passed,—Mrs.
Arthur White in dull white silk, a comfortable,
portly presence—Mrs. Clayton, still trying to attract
attention with a jingle of bangles, but his eyes were
blank;—Diana Churton, hard and metallic and
burnt to the collar-line, beneath which her bare
neck was startlingly fair;—then a tall woman with
a well-groomed head, and a black velvet rose nestling
against the rich whiteness of her skin. He
scanned her as keenly as though he saw her for the
first time, and he felt sure she did not notice it as
she went calmly by, so softly unconscious of him
that she was as easily graceful as though no strong
masculine eyes were searching her from the crown
of her head to the little foot that had a new meaning
to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory held the door until the last silk
skirts had swept into the further room. Then he
went back to his seat and sat down, and the talk
buzzed round him of sugar works and hemp-crops,
and mixtures of races in Key Island, while a few
men talked promotion and the chances of the
army. Between his feet, as he sat there discussing
his favourite topics, he could still feel
the strange yielding softness of a little satin
slipper....</p>

<p>As Mrs. Lewin entered the drawing-room the
coffee came in from the servants’ quarters. She sat
down in the nearest chair, which happened to be
beside a little table where a fancy mirror lay with
some other trifles. The other women had crossed
over to the coffee-tray; Chum took up the glass
deliberately, and looked at herself; first on this side
and then on that. The inspection was entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p>She laid down the mirror, and smiled as if distinctly
amused. For it had occurred to her that
they had all been fools and had wasted much valuable
time, and when women are fools the men will
not help them out of their folly.</p>

<p>“He is only a man!” she said a little contemptuously,
going back to her first comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>By the time the men came into the drawing-room,
most of the women had drifted out on to the
stoep, but the two Bridge tables were placed and
waiting, and the Bridge players sat down to the
serious business of their evening, while Hamilton
Gurney of the Wessex wheeled the piano out into
the cool darkness and fortified by cého began to
sing. He had that gift of the gods a real tenor
voice, and when he sang he was suddenly transformed
from an ordinary young man in a Line
Regiment to a satellite of the Angel Israfil, with
power over his fellow-creatures to wring their
hearts and bring tears into their eyes. It is a
little pitiful of human nature that intense pleasure
always shows itself most simply in weeping; for
when the senior sub. of the Wessex had dropped
his last soft note into a listening silence most
of his hearers had uncomfortable lumps in their
throats, and believed that it was a foretaste of
Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin had seated herself in a basket chair
as far from other listeners as she could, for she was
selfish over music, and felt inclined to turn and
rend any one who interrupted her enjoyment of it.
It represented the only violent emotion that she had
really experienced, and she objected to facing the
public with quivering nerves. To-night she was to
be more than usually harrowed because Mr. Gurney,
in a fit of sentimentalism engendered by her own
black rose, had chosen a song with her name interwoven—a
song that Blumenthal loved best of all he
wrote, and which seems as if the accompaniment
were born of the air. It is called “Leoline,” but
Chum missed the reference to herself as completely
as she lost sight of the pink-and-white young man
at the piano who was casting glances at her shadowy
corner. Hamilton Gurney did not realise that he
was merely the vehicle of his own gift, and therefore
he made the mistake of accepting the attention
he knew he received not only as for his voice, but
for his very unimportant self.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin had drifted away into a sea of pain,
as the rich notes played over her nerves. Had she
thought about him she would have been positive
that the Administrator was playing Bridge at Major
Churton’s table, but she was not thinking of him, nor
did she realise until long after the song was over
that he was standing near her, a tall dark shadow
behind her chair, looking with very far-seeing eyes
from Mr. Gurney’s obvious application of his song

</div>

<p>“That’s her name, eh!” said Mr. Gregory, with
some dry amusement. “And that young fool is
trying to catch her attention to the fact. It’s a pity
that he can’t realise his position of a Man behind a
Voice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>Chum moved her head restlessly, conscious that
her heart was beating thickly as only the slow rich
notes ever made it beat. It frightened her to have
even the suspicion of an emotion she could not control,
and this was certainly a thing that seemed
apart from her. Life had been most comfortably
manageable so far.</p>

<p>“I wonder what her husband calls her?” mused
the Administrator, his eyes absently fixed on the
point of a little satin slipper, showing beneath the
frills of her skirt. “Leoline—Lena—Leo—she is
not a woman to lack a pet name, for all her
inches!”</p>

<p>“Chum!” said Captain Lewin, strolling across
the stoep with his hands in his pockets. “Come
in and drink Mr. White’s health—there’s cého
going!”</p>

<p>And a dozen voices seemed to echo his words
from the lighted windows—“Chum, are you out
there?” “Chum—excuse me, Mrs. Lewin, it’s
so catching!—but do come in.” “Come along,
Chum!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“At all events,” said the Administrator, with
an ugly smile, “that name is not sacred to one
person!”</p>

<p>Behind the Lewins’ bungalow the rich hillside
ran up yellow with cane, for their garden joined the
boundaries of Mr. Denver’s estate, and save for a
fringe of logwood and guava the sugar spread all
about his many acres. If Mrs. Lewin crossed the
gravel paths among the rose trees, and pushed her
way through a tangle of debatable ground, she
found herself out among the waving blades that rose
above her height and almost kissed over her head.
She had an insistent love of the early morning,
when the languid air was at least cooled with the
dawn, and full of faint scent; and when her husband
was still sleeping off the healthy effects of two hours’
hard tennis, she would get up and go out, whereby
she gained a very irradicable impression of the
sugar industry in all its phases, from the flat-footed
natives strolling up to work, to the grinding and
heaving of the sugar factories, for she strayed as far
as the actual buildings where it was carried on, and
came back to breakfast with an English appetite,
and a Key Island thirst. Ally called it restlessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>On the morning after the Whites’ dinner, the
spirit woke her early. She rose and dressed, insisting
on a bath at an hour which confirmed the
Arabs’ impression of British insanity, and went out
into the blue day. There were clouds over Maitso,
but the gracious morning was very hushed and
calm. Chum threaded the garden, and invaded the
brushwood beyond, where the blue-gum and
eucalyptus trees marked the boundary of her own
territory, and the dew lay heavy on her white
skirts. A meerkat jumped across her feet, as she
pushed out into the fields of cane, and then the
slope of the mountain rose before her, pure green
with sugar, a delight to look upon. This land belonged
to Mr. James Denver, the father of the
young lady whose name was connected in every
Key Island mouth with Hamilton Gurney’s, and the
ugly chimneys of his factory rose half-way up the
hill, above the long, grey sugar works. The men
had gone to their labour half-an-hour since, and
Mrs. Lewin pushed her way boldly in between the
ridges where the cane grew, and sauntered along,
feeling that life was very good, and that Earth smelt
like Heaven, as indeed it did if Heaven is a combination
of hothouse and conservatory. In a land
where every other tree flowers, and where gardenias
riot in the hedges, it seems as if the essence of all
the honey that was ever gathered was resolved back
into its original elements within one’s immediate
surroundings.</p>

<p>Last night’s success was really the satin lining to
Mrs. Lewin’s mood, for there is no factor so conducive
to physical pleasure as a gentle mental stimulant.
She had made the worn-out discovery that
a man is best reached through his emotions, and
that his reason is a secondary line of attack, and it
amused her. But she was really not thinking of the
object of her success so much as generalising over
the frailty of his sex, when suddenly she saw him
coming towards her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>A swell of ground, and a cross track through the
cane, had hidden the Administrator until they were
only a few yards distant from each other. Without
a suspicion of his nearness, any more than she had
been when Gurney sang, Chum came through the
dancing morning, while the great green cane bowed
over her head and made a royal avenue for her as
she passed, as of sunshine dripping through clear
emeralds—so liquid yellow was the light through
the blades. She had grown to love the cane, from
the light emphatic patches of it in distance, to the
near waving blades so suggestive of sweet taste in
their very colour. There was a little Nigger song
that Hamilton Gurney sang in a voice as luscious as
the sugar; she hummed it as she passed—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Gregory!”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mrs. Lewin!”</p>

<p>They were conscious eyes this time, that looked
down in their penetration at every feminine attraction
presented to him. The secretary’s wife stood
the inspection with the unconscious serenity of last
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“How very unofficial of you to be out like this!
One dispenses with outriders and a flourish of
trumpets in Key Island, but one does expect to
think of the Administrator breakfasting in languid
dignity while other people are already abroad!”</p>

<p>He made a wry face. “We are very unofficial
here, thank Heaven! It is one of the few advantages
of our diminutiveness. Where are you going,
to Denver’s?”</p>

<p>“No, I was trespassing on his ground, merely for
a stroll.”</p>

<p>“You have seen the factory?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, though I have ventured as far as the
door.”</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said unceremoniously. “It is
just up the hill—I’ll take you round.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin smiled inwardly, and picking up her
spotless skirts stepped into the next furrow. Here
the cane had been cut, but a little further on the
golden green blades drove them into the draining
ditch until they struck the road which cut the field
in two. There were rough tram-lines running
along it, and a small engine was hauling the trucks
up and down the hillside to the factory. Gregory
stopped the man who was just starting the load, and
there was a brief colloquy. Then he turned to the
last truck, which, unlike its fellows, was not open to
the sky and loaded with the cane, but resembled a
waggon without ends, and had rough seats running
down each side of it. This was the riding truck,
and throwing a piece of matting over a seat he put
his hand under Mrs. Lewin’s arm and lifted rather
than helped her in, for the step was steep. In the
midst of her amused excitement she was conscious
of his unceremonious strength, and with the instinctive
feminine compliment to it her own weakness
and helplessness seemed suddenly to have
increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“We shall have time to go round before that
breakfast you insist on my eating in my official
capacity,” he said, and his lips smiled, while his lidless
eyes never narrowed from their intense stare at
her. It began to give her a sense of weariness, a
feeling that he had never ceased looking at her
since the night before, when he was first conscious
of her presence. Perhaps he had been doing it in
his own mind all the night.</p>

<p>The movement of the trucks was surprisingly
smooth, but they were all worked on springs.
They swept up through the furrowed fields, and
came to a clinking standstill before the gaping
mouth of the factory. It seemed to Mrs. Lewin a
zinc building with a whirr of machinery inside too
large for its frail shell, and the impression increased,
rather than otherwise, when she entered. All the
world was suddenly transformed to sugar—the rich
smell of it was in the air, the dark stream of it falling
from the pipes to the big teaches and the
cooler, the very floor sticky with it, so that she
stepped aside from the pools of hot liquid. After
the increasing glare outside the dark of the place
was grateful, and through the dark were visible
bronzed forms, stripped and dripping with sweat,
guiding the machinery, shovelling down the waste
for fuel, and chopping at the congealed masses of
the later stages of the sugar with some pronged
instrument. There was labour on every hand, and
the restless tide of human life seemed gathered into
an ordered groove of industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Gregory led his companion up steep ladders and
over wet stones without consideration for her fresh
skirts, explaining the process as they went on. It
was wonderful how his forceful whispers carried
through the whirr of the flying wheels, and he took
it off-handedly for granted that Mrs. Lewin would
miss no detail on account of her clothes. He knew
the work as well as its owner, and dipped the testing-tube
into the refining sugar to show her how
the lime had purified the dirty liqueur to a pure gold
like honey. Further on, at the end of the building,
were the great vats where rum was fermenting,
and an odour like rich wine rose in Chum’s nostrils
as he lifted the lid and showed her the frothy,
muddy contents.</p>

<p>“Dip in your finger—it’s warm,” he said, stirring
it with his own. Mrs. Lewin, balancing on a
precarious plank, with her dainty skirts held high,
was conscious of an inward shudder as her long
white hand touched the strong-smelling stuff, and
yet it never occurred to her to disobey, or so
much as enter a protest.</p>

<p>“Is this what the natives <i>drink</i>?” she said, in
mild surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes—by-and-by, when it’s cleared. Filthy
stuff!” he said shortly. “It’s better than hemp,
though. Can you get down? Better let me lift
you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>But she laid her cool hands in his and jumped,
landing safely at his side, and again conscious of
his physical as well as mental power. Then the
sight-seeing was over, and he led the way out by
another door and round to the waiting trucks to
ride back. Here Gregory paused a minute, and
looked over the waving crops and the flourishing
scene of labour with an expression that Mrs. Lewin
did not at the moment understand. When he had
come to Key Island the sugar-planters were sullen
and depressed; they wanted encouragement from
the Home Government, and they regarded the
change of administration in Key Island as no benefit
to themselves. The old <i>régime</i> had been a bad
one, and had ended in disaster; but they knew at
least what they had to expect, and the first “spring
cleaning” of the Imperial Government had alarmed
them with grave prognostications for the future of
the island. Gregory had already made them change
their opinions during the short time he had been in
possession. He had thrown himself heart and soul
into the industries of the island, and so assured the
planters that Port Victoria would not be merely a
coaling-station. Because he was in earnest he
gained their confidence, and worked with them to
make the land prosperous again. The humming
factories were a proof of his success; he saw his
schemes fulfilling themselves actually before him,
and his hard eyes brightened with the strange look
over which Mrs. Lewin pondered all the way home.
It was, in a degree, the same look that makes a
young mother most ineffably, justifiably proud—the
look that is but a reflex of God’s when, His work
spread before Him, He saw that it was very good.
For there is no joy like the joy of creation.</p>

<p>“What is he thinking about?” said Leoline
Lewin to herself, with awakened interest, her eyes
on the Administrator’s reserved face.</p>

<p>“Denver employs six hundred on his estate
alone,” was all Gregory remarked aloud. “I wish
all the planters took as many.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“If there were no idlers, there would be less likelihood
of a rising. When the Key’landers begin to
sit in the gutter and jaw through the Miroro (sleep
hour) in a snarly sing-song, then look out. It began
that way last time.”</p>

<p>“Ah!—Mr. Gregory, what would happen if you
burnt the hemp-crops?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know.” But he looked at her in some
surprise for the audacity of her question. It had
been tacitly understood that such an extreme
measure might be attempted by this Administrator
only; but no one had even broached such a subject
to himself. Gregory thought of the unlikelihood of
his secretary even speculating on such an idea, and
smiled even more broadly. Decidedly this girl
ought to have been the boy!</p>

<p>“It might bring matters to a head, and I don’t
know that I should be sorry,” he admitted after a
moment. “There is a lot of underhand discontent,
and the population is like a silly child who overestimates
its own importance and power to be
naughty. A sharp lesson might clear the air—see?”</p>

<p>It is wonderful how indiscreet men will be to a
pretty woman. Mrs. Lewin knew how to listen;
also as Evelyn Gregory talked he could see himself
reflected in the big pupils of her eyes, and his
mental attitude reflected in the equally receptive
calibre of her mind. He was not very used to
sympathy in his schemes, because he rarely confided
them to any one, and he fancied Mrs. Lewin
the more exceptional on this account, whereas she
was merely more adroit in drawing him on. She
was, besides, really interested, and he saw that, and
saw also that she was a woman, which touched his
senses, and ended by driving the more serious side
of the conversation out of his head. For Chum,
with a flash of genius, dropped the political standpoint
at her own gate, and held out her hand with
a merely social attractiveness.</p>

<p>“My husband will be ravenous, and I shall get
scolded,” she said, with a smile in the changing
colours of her eyes. “But I was very interested—it
was your fault!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>The curve of her lips was not a pout, but Mr.
Gregory suddenly saw himself as a successful rival
to Captain Lewin as regarded his wife’s time—the
masculine cause of a scolding too, for a more subtle
suggestion than a late breakfast lay in the words.
He smiled a little also, and the blood beat with a
small pleased triumph in the hand that held hers.</p>

<p>“He must like me, if he is to like Ally!” said
Chum to herself in vague excuse, as she went into
her room to change her soiled skirt and shoes.
“And that is the only way to attract him, as yet....
What a harsh, ugly face he has!—Been
waiting long, Ally?”</p>

<p>Fresh from her encounter with the Administrator,
her husband’s good looks struck her with a sudden
pride in possession. She paused behind his chair,
and laying her hands on his shoulders bent down to
kiss him and talk tender nonsense.</p>

<p>“Dear thing! how nice it looks in its beautiful
white clothes!” she said softly, her arm round the
broad shoulders under the cool linen coat.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, old girl?” Ally returned,
pushing his chair back from the table to
return the caress heartily. “I’ve been dressed half-an-hour.”</p>

<p>“Up to Denver’s Works, and all round them with—who
do you think? Three guesses!”</p>

<p>“Halton!”</p>

<p>“Wrong!—Silly boy! as if I didn’t love my
beautiful husband better than hundreds of Mr.
Haltons!”</p>

<p>“I know you do!—I should think it very bad
taste if you didn’t,” said Ally, calmly. “Brissy,
then?”</p>

<p>“No,—why, he is orderly officer this week!”</p>

<p>“Which is all that lies between me and the
Divorce Court evidently! Well, I don’t think you
have another mash, Chum—unless it’s Churton?”</p>

<p>“All wrong. I fly at higher game. Now
then!”</p>

<p>“Not——”</p>

<p>“The Administrator!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Ally whistled. “You don’t say so!” he said.
“How the deuce did it happen?”</p>

<p>“He met me trespassing on the estate and
asked me to go. Now I think of it, he never said
why <i>he</i> was there, but he seemed like a second
owner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is well in with all the Planters.
Well?”</p>

<p>“He asked me to go, as I say, and I went.
Listen, Ally”—and she left him and walked round
to her end of the table—“he became almost confiding
about the natives. I shall know his schemes
yet, and then I can tell you, and knowledge is
power! He will think you have divined his mind.”</p>

<p>“Catch me divining his mind! It would be like
groping in a fusty roomful of blue-books! Oh, by
the way, Chum, Gurney wants to sell that grey
pony of his—I think we might as well have another.”</p>

<p>“No, but do listen, Ally! At present the native
question is so hopeless because of the mixed races
and opposing interests, but if a good breed predominated—the
Hovas, for instance—and we could
get them to come over and leaven the lump——”</p>

<p>A big hard-backed beetle had floundered on to
the table right in front of Alaric’s plate, and instinctively
he had set his glass of iced water on it.
The glass being nearly empty the beetle was walking
away with it, and with Alaric’s attention at the
same time. Chum stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“You don’t care!” she said, with a sudden blank
feeling upon her. “You are much more interested
in playing school-boy tricks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, really! But I’m so sick of
Gregory’s importation and emigration schemes.”
Ally’s eyes were affectionate and apologetic too.
He looked like a big dog accustomed to petting,
and very unaccustomed to being chidden. “I say,
Chum, do look at this fellow though! The other
night at mess we got a lot,—every one of us had
a beetle, and laid odds as to whose would fly off
first. You know if you turn them on their backs,
ten to one they can’t get up, and if you even
touch them——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>But now it was Chum’s attention which had
wandered, nor was she very concerned with the
intellectual pursuits of the Wessex mess. She felt
that the racing of hard-backed beetles was the limit
of their capacity: and then reproached herself for
self-conscious superiority. The question of Key
Island and its possible improvements dropped to
pieces, nor was it revived successfully on other
occasions. But Captain Alaric Lewin escaped
from work early that day, and rode out to Maitso
with his wife, where from four o’clock to six they
played at Go-one-better, which is a very instructive
game needing nothing but five handkerchiefs and
a Panama hat, and affords some amusement if you
cannot play tennis. The grass was wet, but they
laughed themselves thirsty over Go-one-better, and
then sat on the stoep of the mess and drank cého,
and when the Administrator’s A.D.C. and Mrs.
Lewin left, Ally was conscious of no flaw in his
domestic bliss. Key Island was a beastly hole, and
he must really look up all the influence he could to
get a decent Station—for Chum’s sake, of course—but
in the meantime one could have a very pleasant
time if there were people like the Churtons and old
Bristles round. To-morrow they would play Polo
of sorts—Gurney must learn not to cross, though!—and
Wednesday was gymkana. If only he had been
more of an A.D.C. and less of a secretary, even work
would not have been so irksome. But the Administrator
chafed at entertainments, and when he was
forced into some formality at Government House
he usually managed to be summoned away, and left
Halton to represent him and Mrs. White to entertain.
It was a saying in Key Island that he paid
the Town Wardens of Port Albert and China Town
an extra stipend to telephone for him on such
occasions, and only when a Government House
dinner was unavoidable did Mr. Gregory appear as
a host. Since Ally had been out there had been
no entertainment at Government House, and his
social gifts were wasted. It would have been dull
enough, no doubt, but still something to do, he
thought, and better than all clerical work, and he
yawned over the morrow’s monotony as he laid his
handsome, empty head on the pillow that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>What Mrs. Lewin thought of the last twenty-four
hours’ experiences she no longer tried to make him
understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>The way of the Army woman is hard. She
starts as a nice girl, with a weakness for red cloth
and jingles; but then she marries, and discovers,
amongst other shocks, what lies beneath the red
cloth. Her husband may still be her ideal hero to
her, or he may be merely the figure-head of a
position in which she gets plenty of attention and
some amusement; but his profession will inevitably
take her into desert places of the earth where she
samples discomfort until the iron enters into her
domestic soul. If it be in India she will do pretty
well, until he gets a bad Station, though even the
horrors of loneliness and fever may be mitigated by
obtainable service. But by the time she is suddenly
transferred with him to another Colony there will be
a nursery in progress, and then the tragedy—the
ugly, sordid tragedy of a married life stripped of its
decencies and privacies—will very possibly begin.
She will leave her comfortable staff behind her,
because of the Emigration Act, and on the troop-ship
she will begin to taste the joys of being her own
nurses and maid. Then her temper wears, and she
has not quite so much time to spend over her
appearance, but instinct holding good she adopts
the harder and more masculine style as being easier
to compass under all trials of circumstance. Foreign
Stations batter the daintiness of life out of her, the
narrow limits of the Army world distort her mental
vision, the drawbacks she struggles to overcome
leave their mark on her. Finally there comes the
day when even the hateful little compensations to
which she has become used have to be given up—the
snobbish sense of position, and the dangling
after her of men other than her husband, who find
in her a <i>passée</i> fashion,—for the soldier’s service is
over, and then comes Ealing and a dress allowance
to be saved up for the sales.</p>

<p>Diana Churton had reached the ominous point in
her career when she saw half-pay darkening the
horizon. It was unlikely that Major Churton would
ever be given the regiment, and, as he said, twenty
years of foreign service had made the solid dullness
of England a home to his weary eyes. Diana had
no children to plot and plan for, and marry into the
same life that she had found a dubious success;
their one little girl had died at Agra, and the dumb
tragedy of their lives was in the moment when they
turned away from the little grave, in a city for ever
sacred to the dead by that grand white memory
called the Taj, and went their separate ways. The
child as she grew older might have drawn them
closer together again; her grave somehow thrust
them apart.</p>

<p>“If he thinks I neglected her, or that it was my
fault, I could kill him!” thought the woman fiercely,
jealous of her motherhood.</p>

<p>“If she hints that I do care, I shall lose my control—better
let the very subject alone,” thought the
man, for he was afraid of his own temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>So Di Churton dropped the remnants of her girlhood
into the void of her husband’s silence, and life
went on as before—always the indefinite man who
rode with her and danced with her, always the hard
tongues of the Station and the keeping just on the
safe side, always the restless, feverish desire to get
something out of life and the sense of disillusion.
She never lost her husband’s confidence, for she was
a wise woman; but she learned a mutual accommodation
when “Bute was thick with Mrs. So-and-so.”
Diana was attracted by men rather than her
own sex; she was in few senses a nice woman, and
unless she had an object in cultivating them, the
other ladies in the garrison found her frankly rude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>At Port Victoria she was fairly intimate with
Mrs. Gilderoy until the arrival of the Lewins,
whereupon she transferred her preference to Leoline,
not only on account of Alaric, but because
Chum was obviously successful socially, and Bute
was conveniently attracted. It would have suited
Mrs. Churton very well to have the Lewins nearer,
for the distance up to Maitso from their bungalow
was a frequent reason for Mrs. Lewin to slip out of
an invitation there. It happened one morning, for
instance, that on a day when Diana had planned to
have her company Chum rode into town late, and
gave herself a headache with the heat and the
exhaustion of the air. The smell of Port Victoria
is peculiarly its own, and seems to be compounded
of all the mixed races that inhabit it, not excepting
the white, for the hot khaki certainly lends its own
peculiar flavour. The humid streets do not smell of
the packed stores, or of the decaying vegetation, or
even of the need for drainage, though they might
do so, and it is a surprise to those who know the
place that they do not; but the juices of warm
Chinaman and Negro and Arab and Malagasy,
seem to merge and produce an effect that is numbing
to the uninitiated. After six months or so in
the town people declare that they hardly notice it,
but Mrs. Lewin had not reached that stage. She
turned Liscarton’s head towards the hillside, and
felt thankful that if her homeward way was to be
overscented it would be with too much sweetness
rather than otherwise. For it was a characteristic
of Port Victoria that its rank nastiness should be succeeded
by enervating odours of flowers the minute
one gets out of the streets and into the blossoming
tangle of hills round about.</p>

<p>The town seemed unusually glaring, and clattered
with khaki. The rattling by of an officer’s pony,
and the salute flashed into her dazzled eyes, made
Chum’s head swim, until she was faintly conscious
of something else that distracted her attention from
herself. It was the hour of the Miroro—the noonday
sleep—and the coloured people had lounged
out of store and wharf and were sitting in the
gutters and on the steps of the houses, eating
fessikh and dozing and playing native games. But
above it and through it all rang a sing-song snarl of
patois, like the complaining note of a caged beast.
Liscarton almost stopped for the instinctive pressure
on his rein, and Mrs. Lewin turned in her saddle to
look back at the streets she was leaving. She
remembered Gregory’s warning as to the signs of
trouble; this sounded like it, this strange note of
dissatisfaction in the general hum.</p>

<p>“I will speak to Ally, and ask him if there is
anything fresh—any measure of the Government
that is unpopular,” she thought, beginning to canter
up-hill mechanically. A Key Island pony will
always canter his hills, unless really tired, upon the
principle that it is better to get over a difficulty
quickly and breathe yourself afterwards. He is
bound to be hot with the climb, and the impetus of
a quicker motion carries him over the rough ground
with greater ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>As Chum entered the delicious coolness of their
own bungalow, the telephone rang, and she went to
answer it. Her husband’s voice spoke to her,
faintly muffled.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?... Oh, is it you, Chum?
I’m at the club, and it’s too late to come out.
Brissy’s lunching with me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t drink too many céhos!” said Chum
resignedly from her end of the communication tube.
“And tell Captain Nugent I expect him to dinner
to-morrow—he can bring the banjo.”</p>

<p>“All right. Well, look here, Chum, I’m dining
with the Churtons unfortunately—they want to
know if you can ride out too?”</p>

<p>“My head is too bad. I’m only just out from
town, and the heat made it ache a good deal. I’m
afraid I should be the skeleton at the feast if I
attempted to get up to Maitso. It’s nothing—don’t
be a silly boy! I shall have to make the
effort and come to the Churtons if you bother.”</p>

<p>“No don’t, if you feel seedy. I’ll ride out and
see how you are after lunch.”</p>

<p>“You are not to do anything of the kind—it’s
too hot for you. Stay at the club. Oh, Ally——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Is there anything going on in the Legislature?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of more than the usual—ahem!—grind.
What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I only thought—oh, nothing. Give
my love to Di.”</p>

<p>“All right. Take care of yourself, dear.” Ally
rang off hastily, and turned to drink cého with
relief. He was not a hypocrite, and he had reached
a point when he did not want Chum to send her
love to Mrs. Churton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>After all, he did not ride out to their bungalow,
for he talked horse with Captain Nugent to the
accompaniment of many whiskies, and then it
seemed too late, remembering that he had to dress—he
had had his clothes sent down to the club—and
get his pony and ride up to Maitso. But
Brissy was not pressed for time, and offered himself
as a substitute, whereby it came to pass that he
turned up to have tea with Chum, and impressed
her anew in her secret heart with his absolute
inferiority to Ally, and the wearying vacuum of his
brains.</p>

<p>“He is like a bad copy of Ally, too,” she thought
critically, looking at the burnt face and the young
eyes drawn round with spurious wrinkles by foreign
service. Under the black moustache Brissy’s teeth
flashed as he talked, for he had a trick of drawing
back his upper lip, and above his low forehead the
dark hair thatched an unusually flat head. Owing
to vivid colouring, he was considered a handsome
man among his fellows; but Mrs. Lewin did not
admire him.</p>

<p>“His eyes have no soul in them—he is just a
healthy animal!” she said to herself disparagingly,
as he stolidly drank his fourth cup of tea and
showed no signs of going. “Oh, thank Heaven,
Ally is not like this! What shall I talk about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>It seemed ridiculous to think of Brissy as a
father, and Mrs. Lewin never drew him on to domestic
subjects as she might other married men,
partly because it struck her as inappropriate to him,
and partly because there was a general belief in
Key Island that he would have liked to bring his
wife out with him, but that Mrs. Nugent had not
been attracted by a small and dull Station such as
Port Victoria, and had preferred to wait until he
had something better. Brissy staunchly asserted
that her health would not stand the heat, but Captain
Gilderoy had shrugged his shoulders to a select
audience, and given it as his opinion that at the last
moment Mrs. Nugent had jibbed! The theory met
with credence, and therefore Chum talked banjos
and ponies rather than married interests, and had
no suspicion that Brissy’s unemotional eyes strayed
round the home, for which he envied “old Ally
Sloper,” with a secret wistfulness. He was adding
her presence at her husband’s side to the long list
of advantages with which he had already endowed
her, while she privately decided that a lifelong
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with Bristow Nugent would exhaust the
vitality of any woman, and that Mrs. Nugent’s
absence needed no explanation to a sympathetic
mind.</p>

<p>Her thoughts touched Ally with fonder appreciation
in contrast. He was at the moment just riding
leisurely up the winding road that led to Maitso,—a
handsome fellow, and well contented with himself,
and his wife with him. On his right rose the
solid buildings of the Mess, and as the path swung
over the hill, corkscrew-wise, the dotted barracks
grouped themselves on either hand. It was like a
town in itself, intersected with the irrepressible
vegetation which broke out into guava and logwood
brush even here. Maitso looked “greener” and
more deserving of its name than it really was from
the town; but as Captain Lewin rode up to the
Churtons’ quarters, he passed through the slight
screen of logwood, and was shielded from the setting
sun.</p>

<p>“Come in, Ally. Bute’s somewhere at the
Mess,” said Mrs. Churton, appearing on the stoep.
“Where’s Chum?”</p>

<p>“She had a headache—said she was awfully sorry
she didn’t feel up to coming. I’m glad she didn’t
try, it was so hot riding up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry she couldn’t, though, as we shall be
odd numbers. Poor old fellow! you are hot!
Will you have a cého or whiskey?” Diana was
hospitable.</p>

<p>Ally chose cého, but the whiskey followed, and
when the Major appeared they had more, sitting out
until dinner-time and talking in a desultory fashion,
while they watched the sky darken behind the
solemn fans of the ravenalas. How hot it was!
Even up at Maitso the freshness seemed to have
been melted from the sea breeze before it reached
them, and the heavy air clung like a miasma. It
was intoxicatingly sweet, but languid and enervating
until the beads of sweat stood on the men’s
temples without more exertion than their own
vitality, and even Diana Churton gasped.</p>

<p>“By Jove! it’s been a swilling day!” Major
Churton remarked, as he stretched his hand for
the whiskey. “My throat feels like blotting-paper.
Have some more, Lewin?”</p>

<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>There were no ladies present at dinner besides
Di, but two men from Mitsinjovy dropped in, and
presently they played Poker. Ally was one of the
winners, but more by luck than judgment, for the
heat—or something else—seemed to be making his
head heavy. Twice he thought he got up to go,
and then some one said the night was yet young,
and his limbs felt comfortably indisposed to bestir
themselves. When midnight struck he dragged
himself to his feet with a feeling of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Great Scot! Chum will think I’m killed—had
a headache, too, poor little soul!” he said vaguely.
His splendid, vacant face was turned to the hot night
beyond the open doors; he was wondering how he
should ever get down that winding hill in the dark
with this stupid feeling in his brain. He must trust
to the pony, it was no good worrying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>Diana beckoned him imperiously on to the stoep,
and he obeyed, pulling himself together and walking
straight, without control of his own body, it
seemed, into the cooler night air. She was holding
one of the big Mess tumblers, with the Wessex
crest on it, sparkling with whiskey and soda, and
deliciously cold with ice.</p>

<p>“A stirrup cup!” she said hurriedly. “Come,
you must drink it! You are sleepy with the heat
of the rooms. This will brace you up to get
home.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Di, I’ve had enough.”</p>

<p>But she laughed and lifted it to his lips for him,
and his hand closed on hers and the glass together.
Ally was smoking, but he took the cigar from his
lips as if he wondered what to do with it, and Mrs.
Churton held it for him while he drank, sniffing it
appreciatively. To some women the smell of smoke
is a kind of lurid dissipation. The taste of tobacco
in their own mouths is not nearly so suggestive to
them. Ally finished the whiskey, and then something
happened. He did not seem able to hold the
glass, and it fell and smashed at his feet. He was
troubled, because it belonged to the Mess, and those
glasses were expensive things, and had to be made
in England; but Mrs. Churton coolly kicked the
fragments out of the way, and said it did not matter.
At least the whiskey had not been wasted!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>How dark it was on the stoep, and how hot and
still! Up in the further corner no one could see
them from the lighted room. He remembered
nothing of getting there, only that her face looked
softer than usual in the little light there was; and
when she put her cool hands behind his head and
kissed him, he felt a sly amusement that she should
be so much more keen than he; there was a passion
in her kisses, while there was none, he thought, in
his. And her voice rang in his ears, “Ally! Ally!
come to me when other women fail you!” while he
wondered that it seemed to mean nothing. He was
far more conscious of the outspread fans of the
ravenalas, as if they would fain screen him from the
night.</p>

<p>Some one brought his pony round then, and he
mounted, surprised it was so easy, and turned the
brute’s head down the slope. Their voices echoed
after him and died away on the stillness of the air,
bidding him good-night, chaffing him noisily, confusing
the way he was going. It was impossible
to judge one building from another now, and the
damned paths wound round and round like a maze.
He should take a wrong turning—no, this was
safer! He drove his spurs into his pony’s flanks
and tore down the hill at a gallop, holding the animal
mechanically from stumbling, but trusting to
his instinct to get down safely. Why they did not
pitch down the steep slopes he did not know, but
he was not in the least afraid; a mad exhilaration
took hold of him through the wild ride, and he
urged the pony on still when he got to the foot of
the hill, and clattered through the sleeping town,
but the pony knew his way home. Stumbling
and dripping with sweat, man and horse galloped
the last few yards, and swept up to the very stable
door, where the pony stopped with falling head and
streaming flanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Ally slipped out of the saddle, feeling his mount
vaguely, and trying to find the words to explain
that he was to be rubbed down and handled carefully,
but they would not come, and he gave the
rein in silence to a sleepy sais, who seemed to have
risen out of the shadows of the stoep. A minute
later his voice came back in a curse, for he tripped
over the bodies of his own servants crouched close
to the cool stones. There were more than the men
of his household there, but he did not know. He
fumbled at the door, got it unlatched, and reeling
over to his dressing-room, dropped like a stone on
to the floor in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>The heat of the night had prevented Chum from
sleeping at first, and though her headache had
driven her to bed early, she had lain there for an
hour looking up at the white fall of the mosquito
curtain, and listening to the stupid bustle of a hard-back
who had drifted in from the outside world in
company with a dozen moths, and was floundering
to find his way out again. She fell asleep at last
listening for Ally’s pony to come up the hill, and
was in a deep slumber when the bang of a door
shook her awake as completely as if she had never
closed her eyes. She sat up in bed, wondering
what had happened, and listening to some one who
seemed to be strange to the house, and was trying
to find his way about. A man must have got in,
and she was all alone; yet the boldness of the
intruder’s movements as regarded noise, and his
lack of caution, were very unlike the stealthiness of
the coloured thief. At last the steps found Ally’s
dressing-room, and passed in. There was an instant’s
pause, a heavy fall, and silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin was standing at the closed door between
the two rooms almost before the sound had
ceased; she had no knowledge of how she came
there, or of how her fingers let down the rattling
shutter with some vague idea of seeing through the
opened slits. But there was darkness in the dressing-room,
and she opened the door with one hand
and switched on the electric light with the other,
even as she passed in. Nothing had been touched
from the time when she last saw Ally’s man putting
it in order that morning. His master having
dressed at the club, the place had had an air of
lonely neatness all day, for Ally was regally careless
how he flung his clothes about when present.
Mrs. Lewin took a step forward and almost trod
upon his prostrate body before she saw that the
heavy dark something in the middle of the floor
was a man.</p>

<p>He was lying nearly on his back, having turned
in his fall with an instinctive effort towards the air.
She dropped on her knees beside him, her heart
beating heavily with the remembrance that the
nearest doctor was half-an-hour’s ride away, and
trying to think what one did for a fit. He was
breathing heavily, and his face was flushed and
heated. She bent down to wrench open the
soaked collar ... and drew back with a
choking breath.</p>

<p>Leoline Lewin had seen drunken men before—labourers,
lying on alehouse benches, or in the sun;
ragged wretches soaked in gin to drown their
misery, and slinking past the police. She had
heard stories, too, of her own male acquaintance
being overcome upon occasion, and had found
them funny enough to laugh at as told by their
friends. But the real experience had never touched
her before, nor had she seen the man who had always
stood upright, to her imagination at least,
suddenly cast from his dignity to grovel on the
earth from which he came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>In the revulsion of the shock she stood very upright
herself, as if to prove her own power—a
grave, white figure overlooking the relaxed body in
its tumbled dress-clothes which lay at her bare feet.
Through the appalling silence sounded the man’s
heavy snoring breath, and the thrum of the hard-back
which had followed her into the dressing-room,
and was hitting itself against the beams of
the ceiling.</p>

<p>Suddenly the woman remembered where and
who she was, and what had happened. The little
harassing details of the tragedy came back to her
and woke her to shuddering action. She had been
standing there for some minutes, and half-a-dozen
dangers might have occurred to clench the position.
The servants might hear and come to ask what was
wrong, or some one might have followed Ally to
see him safely home, though a quick glance at the
probabilities reassured her that this—this prostrate
helpless body, was a last stage that had not betrayed
itself before. She sprang at the door and
closed it swiftly, slipping the bolt; then she dragged
the mattress off the couch and pushed it as near
that helpless thing, that seemed no longer her
husband, as was possible; and then, with her strong,
young arms, she took it under the shoulders and
dragged it on to the improvised bed, spreading a
covering sheet over the betraying clothes. The
exertion brought beads of moisture on to her fair
soft body, and she stood up again panting a little,
and trying to realise it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>She must begin and love all over again, if she
were to love so low at all. This degraded Ally,
helpless on her mercy, was no longer the stalwart
husband round whom she had built up her theoretical
married life. A dozen little things that had
been but pinpricks of annoyance started up in her
mind suddenly, to intensify the final blow, and she
saw him as a weak man, without the strenuous love
of fighting and winning which she had tried to
coax into him, self-contented, the mere tool of her
own ambition whenever he had been forced into
action. The bitterness of her thwarted instincts
was uppermost as she turned away. That was the
mate of her own ripe womanhood, the force round
which her eager life was to centre—that poor weak
nature which would resist one temptation as little as
another, for in the cruelty of this revelation she
acknowledged what she had been so pitifully denying
to herself,—that Alaric Lewin was no master
of life, but the sport of his own idle inclinations.</p>

<p>She was moving back to her own room with
dragging feet, when a new terror seemed to spring
up and startle her back into action again. Some
one was coming up the garden path with a heavy
tramp that came straight on towards the stoep and
the house. It was no barefooted Arab, but the
impatient tread of a white man who was his own
messenger, and with a horrible premonition she
knew it from any more probable one that it might
have been. It was the Administrator, and he had
some purpose in thus coming to his Secretary at
one o’clock in the morning. The sing-song snarl
outside the stores and in the gutters, during the
Miroro, came back to her mind ominously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>With some idea of stopping him before he could
rouse the servants to get into the house, she hastily
left the dressing-room, and closing the door behind
her, as if it held an ugly secret, she sped across the
large bare dining-room and slipped back the bolt
of the rough wooden door. But she need not have
troubled herself for the household. Evelyn Gregory
had almost brushed against the sleeping Arabs in
his rapid transit from the garden gate to the house,
but as he passed along the stoep he coolly stepped
over the slumbering tangle at his feet with the
briefest passing scorn for men and women. It
meant nothing to him in his absorption, and indeed
he hardly knew that the humanity he spurned with
his foot was there. He did not expect any of the
servants to answer his knock, but he meant to rouse
Captain Lewin, and with this grim intent he swung
his heavy riding-whip round and brought the
weighted end rattling down on the slight panels of
the door. The whip was his constant companion,
and served not for his ponies, but as a weapon of
defence or of punishment in an emergency. Its
weight was consequently no slight one, but before
he could shake the door again it was quietly opened,
leaving him with the upraised whip in his hand, the
long lash coiled round his wrist, and his whole attitude
unintentionally threatening.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood a marvellous fair woman in
her nightdress, the open neck showing her so warm
and white, that with a little instant thrill he guessed
at the delicious shoulder under the lace. She had
come so swiftly that she had not even drawn the
white silk wrapper closely round her, and one little
slipper had fallen from her; he saw it lying in the
waste of floor behind her, where it had slipped from
her running foot, and he thought of another white
satin morsel that he had held between his own.
The coil of her hair was tossed sideways over her
shoulder, and brushed away from her forehead,
leaving her unusually girlish without its customary
mature dressing, but in her large eyes he saw that
there was not the least thought of him. She was as
unconscious of her sweet bare foot as of his cognizance
of it, nor did she know that her careless whiteness
was a seduction in itself. All her conscious
life centred round the terror of the last few minutes,
so that she saw only the situation she had to face.</p>

<p>“Come in, Mr. Gregory,” she said under her
breath, drawing aside for him to pass in. “What is
it? <i>What</i> is it? Something is wrong!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>She had turned on the light as she came, and it
shone in their two faces, the man still struggling
with his personal thought, the woman strained by
her private dread of discovery. But the light mechanically
influenced her, so that she put up a slight
hand and tugged at the silk wrapper vaguely to
veil her laces and frills. He watched her as if fascinated,
without will-power to turn away, and when
he spoke it was in short clipped phrases, as though
it were an effort.</p>

<p>“There is a threatening of a rising. The police
are out. I want the troops ready. Will you call
your husband?”</p>

<p>There was a blank of silence, while it beat into
her brain that somebody was required to ride to
Maitso and take the alarm. She thought of a dull
figure lying heavily on the floor, breathing stentoriously....</p>

<p>“Captain Lewin was very late in coming home.
He is sleeping heavily. I am afraid it will take
some time to rouse him,” she heard her own voice
saying, in sentences as concise as his. “Would it
not be better to send one of the men? I can call
them in a moment.”</p>

<p>She turned towards the door, but his outstretched
hand guided her back without his having moved a
step.</p>

<p>“I’ll rouse him!” he said grimly. “Which is
his room?”</p>

<p>There was a touch of resentment in him, which
he himself did not know was there, that this heavy
sleeper owned the woman before him. A man
should sleep lightly with her near by, nor ever
lose his happy consciousness of her even in sleep.
There was something gross in the suggestion of her
husband’s heavy slumber.</p>

<p>“Where is Captain Lewin?” he said curtly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>Again she saw in her brain the quiet, orderly
room, the degraded figure, the drunken lethargy
that no imperious summons would break. Here
was Ally’s chance, and he had tossed it away for a
momentary self-indulgence. She felt in her bitter
impotence that his whole life might be squandered
after such a fashion, for where was her confidence
now?</p>

<p>And the Administrator was waiting.</p>

<p>“He is very tired,” she repeated dully, looking up
at Gregory’s sinister height with eyes which had
grown piteous. It seemed to her as if the foundations
of the man were made of granite, and she
were hurling herself against them vainly.</p>

<p>Something in her face seemed to strike him, however,
for he bent a little nearer to her, and looked
almost curiously in her face.</p>

<p>“Is he ill?” he said; and the suppressed tones
of his voice were a mere vibration.</p>

<p>She paused, with a lightning review of such a lie
and its efficacy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said in a low voice, her shamed eyes
dropping from his. “I think—it is—a touch of
fever.” Then in a tone which did not realise its
own despair, “I <i>cannot</i> rouse him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>He stepped back with a long breath, and turned
his face from her for a minute, as if listening to
something afar off. She heard his chest rise and
fall with an extra sense that was not hearing, and
realised that he understood. All the sting and
shame that had gone before seemed to be nothing
in comparison to that moment. He knew, and
he was a hard man who gave no second chances.
Alaric Lewin was a failure to his judgment; not
because he had got drunk on a hot night, which
was nothing, but because he was useless in an
emergency. The cause was little to a mind like
Gregory’s, but the weakness that might fail him
again was unforgivable. He had the reputation of
sweeping such men from his path as useless, without
enmity, but without pity. The hopelessness of
it all!</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard him speaking, and the whispering
voice had a new kindness; he spoke gently,
as if to some small frail thing that must not be
hurt.</p>

<p>“Never mind—don’t try and wake him. I’ll go
myself. Don’t worry. Go to bed and rest. It will
be all right.”</p>

<p>He laid a large hand on her shoulder, as if to impress
the words; she hardly noticed the action, but
felt a dull surprise when he as quickly drew it back.
The man was nothing to her, but a sudden glow of
comfort sprang up in her heart at his last sentence.
If he said it would be all right, he meant his own
coadjutancy to make it so. She felt the power of
his will, but not of his manhood, and her face was
broken into softness as she turned it to him in farewell,
and opened the door for his hasty departure.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he repeated. “Don’t worry; go
to bed yourself, and be quite easy. I am so sorry
to have roused you.” There was a touch of mastery
in his voice, as if he had taken possession of
the situation to heal her physical and mental weariness.
She rested on it unconsciously, with the
woman’s craving for the strong man who shall not
fail her. And Ally, alas, had failed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>As Gregory swung back along the stoep he looked
down, consciously this time, at the sleeping Arabs,
and there was interest and a secret sympathy in his
heart. For the touch of the Eternal Feminine was
on him, and he remembered that to love a woman
was a goodly thing. His footsteps died away into
the darkness of the garden, to the gate where he had
tied his pony, and then after a pause came the sound
of galloping hoofs as he rode off on his own errand.
Mrs. Lewin heard it as she stood at the open shutters
of her own window, for she had mechanically
gone back to her room, and leaned there conscious
of nothing but a horrible reaction from the tensity
of the past few minutes. With a primeval instinct
she turned from the shelter which civilisation has
raised over men’s heads to the healing of the outside
world, for she had a restless craving to get away
from the confinement of the house and the ugly
thing of which she knew in the next room.</p>

<p>The night was quick with fireflies, and the air
was soft and warm to touch. Some winged thing
sailed lazily by and made her start by the whirr of
its heavy body close to her hair—a giant moth it
seemed, with a barrel-like body and wings like a
dragon-fly’s. Down below on the stoep the Arabs
lay asleep.... She pressed her hands over
her wakeful eyes and tried not to sob, schooling
herself because she was a woman—not a child who
cries away the bitterness over a broken toy. This
was more serious than a toy, and yet it seemed just
like an old unreasonable nursery grief, that fretted
for a thing it had endowed with spurious life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>She must begin and love all over again. There
was no stronger nature above her to look up to and
lean on in fancy, even though she guided by her
brighter wits and keener vitality. She had cheated
herself happily in thinking that Ally was really the
moving spirit in their married life, and that he had
a reserve of strength upon which she could lean in
an emergency. He was nothing but a weak man,
who must be shielded before the world, and watched
and helped with tenderest care, but never more
looked up to at quite the same height. No one
should know or guess that he had so fallen; she
would not even have to make excuses for him, she
would manage so cleverly, for that was her new
phase of wifehood. Even as the thought crossed
her mind she turned her head nervously and listened,
fancying that the servants were awake and coming
to ask who her late visitor had been. If she could
only keep it from them till the morning, things
would look more natural. Captain Lewin had slept
in the dressing-room not to awaken her—he had
thrown the mattress on the floor and lay there in
hope of greater coolness. There was more draught
on the floor—at least she could make it appear so.
She went over the details in feverish haste, shielding
and managing already with a woman’s tragic skill.
But that it should have to be so!</p>

<p>Back on her mind flashed the damning certainty
that the one man who should have been ignorant
had found out. She had felt his knowledge through
the horrible pause after her stammering excuse,
through his courteous sparing of her, and quick
substitution of himself as a messenger, through the
kindly fall of his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry; go to bed yourself, and be quite
easy. I will make it all right. I am so sorry to
have roused you.”</p>

<p>She had his promise then to make it all right.
Yes, he could gloss it over too,—he would take the
onus of the situation on himself, and thrust his own
known energy and personal supervision in the face
of comment. At least her success with him had
brought her that—enough interest in herself to make
him spare her husband, for she acknowledged boldly
to herself that it was her own handling of this man
during the past few weeks which had saved the situation
to-night. Yesterday she might have daintily
skirted the truth, but it seemed a small thing beside
the bitter failure of her most intimate life. Gregory
would spare Ally for his wife’s sake, but—the Administrator
having to ride to Maitso in place of his
own A.D.C.! She almost laughed aloud with a
sudden hysterical sense of humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I shall go mad—mad!” she said desperately,
as the keenness of the humiliation stung her afresh.
“It is all spoilt—all that I planned and worked to
do. There is nothing but the Man left to me.”</p>

<p>But with the word the bitterness passed as swiftly
as it had come. The Man was left her, to guard
and cherish if no longer to love, honour, and obey,
for the positions were reversed. Her eyes filled
with lovely tears, and all that was best and most
maternal flooded the soreness from her heart. She
could begin and love all over again—love as one
loves a child, without looking for adequate return,
less selfishly than a wife her husband; she could be
strong for him, and putting her own craving for
protection on one side, thrust her strength between
his weakness and what life had to offer. Her very
first trial would begin to-morrow, when she cringed
to think of the shame awaiting his returning consciousness.
She must help him through that first,
and then arm him for the result of his folly with the
world at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Leoline Lewin turned from the window, and
quietly throwing off her wrapper, lay down on the
bed and went as fast to sleep as if nothing had disturbed
her rest. Part of her theory of life had
been torn from her, and the sting of keen experience
had wounded her into quicker life. But she
was turning her face bravely to meet it, and stood
up under the new stress of life to prove her womanhood.</p>

<p>A cého head is the best incentive to temporary
canonisation that can well be experienced, and
when, according to the old couplet, “The Devil was
sick,” and “A saint would be,” he had probably
been indulging on the preceding night in Key
Island, whose temperature suggests that it is nearer
to his dominion than the rest of the globe. Captain
Lewin woke up on his improvised bed about
half-past four next morning, and wondered if the
swelled weight on the pillow were really his head
or a leaden imitation fastened to his shoulders.
To sleep in evening dress, too, in Key Island is
hardly a profitable experiment, and what with the
sheet spread over him and the liqueur he had
swallowed, Ally’s state was one of satisfactory
discomfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>He kicked off the sheet, and arose cursing.
Then events began to come back to him, and as
he staggered into an upright position—for he was
very shaky—he looked at the mattress on the floor,
and wondered who had mercifully arranged it for
him last night. His memory declined to serve him
beyond an uneasy recollection of a dark corner of
the stoep at the Churtons’ quarters, and Diana’s
stirrup cup. How he had got home he could not
tell, but the state of his mouth informed him
ruefully that he had been very drunk indeed.
Cého has a singular effect upon the glands of the
throat, if taken in large quantities, so that a regular
drinker gets a strange and unclassified disease after
many years’ tippling, which the doctors call
“Drawn threads” for lack of a better name.</p>

<p>Alaric Lewin shuddered a little as he stumbled
over to the door with some idea of closing it if it
were open, and getting himself washed and dressed
into the morning guise of a gentleman. He had
known men with “Drawn threads,” and wondered
how soon the symptoms really showed themselves.
But he need not have feared for his splendid young
constitution, as yet, and a minute later he forgot
the creepy thought in a new wonder.</p>

<p>The door of his dressing-room was bolted. So
was the door into his wife’s room, the latter on the
inner side, for he tried it gently. Some one had
seen him come in last night then, and had done
their best for him, but he had no idea as to
whether it were Chum or one of the servants. He
hoped from the bottom of his soul that it was the
latter, for the reaction from last night’s excess was
having a chastening effect. He was bitterly
ashamed, and as he caught sight of his own face
in the glass, a dark flush swept over his unwholesome
pallor for an instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“Great Scot! I am a sickly beast,” said Ally
fervently, and with a rush of distaste for himself in
his present condition he began to strip hastily,
throwing the clothes aside after his usual careless
fashion. His bath had been placed for him the
night before, and he got into it with a feverish
desire for cleanliness and coolness, but it seemed to
him that the water hissed off his skin, and that
even after a hard rub down there was a burning
heat upon him. He was sick and sorry too, and he
knew enough of the climate to recognise that this
would not do. He had no compunction in rousing
his household, but he devoutly hoped that Chum
might not hear him when he opened his door and
called, for it is a peculiarity of Key Island, that
though there is electric light there, there are no
bells; every one shouts, and for this reason the
servants get into a loafing habit of keeping round
about the open doors, their possible summons being
an excellent excuse for doing no work meanwhile.</p>

<p>By the time Mrs. Lewin came down to breakfast
her husband was already in the room, as smart as
usual, save for the drawn face above the spotless
white linen. The heat seemed to get up as early
as the residents in Key Island, and by eight o’clock
the sun is as strong as at noon on an English June
day. Leoline seemed to feel it oppressive, for she
gasped a little as she came over to the table, and
Ally turned sharply at the slur of her gown over
the bare floor. The holland did not rustle, but she
had a way of moving which was as regal as the
action of a racehorse, and it created a certain stir
of atmosphere about her. It struck Alaric at that
moment that his wife was chic even in her nightdress,
which is a costume resolving most women
back into the original elements of their natures.</p>

<p>For a second they stood on either side the dainty
table, and the embarrassment of the unconfessed
lay deep between them. Then Alaric said “Good-morning,
Chum,” and moved into his place without
raising his eyes. As a rule they kissed each other
as heartily as when they were school-children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin sat down opposite him and began to
pour out the tea. The breaking of the ice rested
with her, but she took it quite naturally; her new
sense of responsibility seemed to make it an
expected thing that she must always from henceforth
take the lead, not as she had hitherto taken
it, with the screen of Ally’s personality around her,
but without disguise.</p>

<p>She looked at the honeycomb on the table, and
observed that Abdallah had not remembered the
butter-knife, an omission to be corrected for the
seventeenth time. Then she pushed the dish of
iced mangoes towards Ally mechanically, and then
she caught her breath again, and spoke—</p>

<p>“You were very late down from the Churtons’,
Ally.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” He had had a whiskey and soda before
breakfast, a “Hair-of-the-dog-that-bit-him” cure
that enabled him to eat; but the food tasted badly
in his mouth at that moment. “Did you hear me
come in?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You bolted the door, and got the mattress on
to the floor, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and it seemed as if the
words would never come.</p>

<p>“I am awfully sorry, Chum.”</p>

<p>“How was it?” she said, half under her breath.
The troubled eyes of husband and wife met across
the gay little table, glittering with their wedding
silver and glass, and rich with strange tropical
fruit and flowers. Ally and Chum had always
revelled in the Key’land breakfast and their foreign
dishes and luxuries,—somehow the sight of it between
them now made what they had to say seem
more tragic by contrast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“It was so awfully hot!” Ally said lamely.
“On my honour, it’s a solitary instance. I haven’t
been squiffy like that except once or twice before
in my life.”</p>

<p>An uncomfortable memory of the Churtons’ stoep
was making him wretched, and the flavour of that
episode tasted worse in his mouth than stale cého.
He fidgeted with the fruit, while Chum on her side
of the table was absorbed by the worse revelation
that she had to make.</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything in town yesterday about
the people being discontented?” she said, feeling
the difficulty like a stone wall before her. “I asked
you through the telephone, but you said no, then,—perhaps
you knew of it later.”</p>

<p>“No, I heard nothing. Is there anything fresh?”
Ally was relieved at the change of subject.</p>

<p>“There was the threatening of a rising——”</p>

<p>“By Jove! was there? Come, that’s exciting.
Anything is welcome to break the monotony of
this dead-alive hole! I shouldn’t have made an ass
of myself last night if it hadn’t been for that,” he
said ruefully, drifting back to his own uneasy sense
of shortcoming.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether anything happened. The
Administrator thought——”</p>

<p>“Where did you see Gregory?” he asked, startled.
“I got off early because he was going round
to Port Albert until Friday. His yacht was waiting
at the quay; I saw it as I rode through town.”</p>

<p>“Then he must have heard something that made
him change his mind, for he did not go. He came
here last night, or rather in the early morning between
one and two.”</p>

<p>“Chum!”</p>

<p>He laid down his knife and fork and looked
at her across the table, his face whitening. But
it was the pity in her eyes, rather than a real understanding
of what had happened, that frightened
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Did he want me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He asked for me? What did you say?”</p>

<p>“I said you were ill—overtired—that I could not
rouse you.”</p>

<p>“And he took that, and went?”</p>

<p>A sense of marvel possessed his wife at the easy
relief of his tone. He thought his difficulty so
easily overcome that it seemed to her childish.
Could he really think that a nature like Evelyn
Gregory’s would be so set aside, brushed off by a
light excuse.</p>

<p>“Yes, he went—but——” She hesitated, and
then it seemed that plain speaking was best. “He
guessed what was wrong, Ally. He kept urging
me to rouse you, and of course I could not. Then
he said he would rouse you himself, and I had to
stop him. He was very good—he spoke quite
kindly, and told me not to worry—he would go to
Maitso himself. But—I do not think he will forget,
though things may seem as usual between you.”</p>

<p>Down the length of the table, between the tall
silver vases of stephanotis and honeysuckle, she
saw his handsome, despondent face, the dark head
leaning on his hand, the passing gravity which
made him seem noble clouding out his usual
laughter. Gravity and a touch of pensive regret
suited Alaric as even his debonair self-assurance
did not do. He had never looked handsomer than
just then.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry. I have made a fool of myself.”
He spoke humbly, and yet somehow seemed
more of a man than she had thought him since last
night. “You are disappointed, Chum!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“It’s not my loss, Ally, it’s yours. And it
doesn’t matter being disappointed if we can go on
all right now. I think we can pull straight again,
old fellow.” She was pitifully anxious to help him,
and to get that look off his face that made her
heart ache. He must be encouraged like a child,
as well as chidden. She hated to see him carry his
head without the usual insolence of his own good
looks. As she poured out a second cup of tea for
him—the “drawn threads” of his throat burnt like
thirst—she rose and carried it round to him herself,
with a kind young hand laid on his shoulder. The
little extra attention, when he knew she might have
reproached him, touched Alaric the more, because
he looked on his wife as an undemonstrative woman.
He turned swiftly from the table and laid his head
against her breast with a boyish gesture. In truth,
he wanted comforting, for he was face to face with
his own responsible mistake, and fortune had petted
and spoiled him hitherto rather than met him with
the grim face she wore to-day. There was a little
silence while Leoline stroked the dark hair, and held
him tenderly against her. But her eyes looked out
over his head with the expression of one who has
gazed in the face of Medusa. She had that new
protective feeling for something weaker than herself,
but it was no longer the theoretical Ally she
had married and set on a hymeneal pedestal.</p>

<p>“Don’t, dear!” she said at last, and her voice was
a whisper. “It is not a hanging matter—we won’t
let it be. I will help you—may I?”</p>

<p>“You’re the best of Chums!” he whispered back
with a rather uncertain smile. “But you shan’t
have to pull me up for boozing. I don’t know how
it happened last night—we were all playing Poker,
and their quarters are so hot, and we kept on with
whiskey after whiskey. I must have come down
that hill like a madman!”</p>

<p>She gave a dismayed exclamation. “Did any
one hear you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Half the town I should think, and all our servants.
It’s no use not facing it, you know, and
fellows have got drunk before.”</p>

<p>“We must live it down anyhow, Ally. If only
it had not been last night! And the Churtons
know.” She spoke in short, pausing sentences,
thinking it out. “We don’t know the real extent
of the mischief until we hear whether the rising
were anything serious.”</p>

<p>A sudden passing gloom darkened his face again.
“Gregory never forgives that kind of thing. Dear,
this means ruin to any career for me!”</p>

<p>He rose impatiently, and began to stroll up and
down the room, as though he could not sit still.
After a minute she followed him, and put her arms
round him, bringing him to a standstill. The warm,
motherly look of love that had been in her eyes
last night was there again as she lifted her head and
looked at him.</p>

<p>“I don’t care, darling, as long as we are side by
side, and can help each other!” she said. “Only
let us stand or fall together!”</p>

<p>The silent, golden day was unbroken by any
whisper, but the two kissed each other gently for
promise, and looked into each other’s faces with
a gravity too gentle for passion. While the best
side of our nature is uppermost a vow seems almost
superfluous. If reason will not bind us, a futile
fear of our own oath is a poor alternative. Unfortunately,
the best side of our nature so seldom
remains in the ascendant, but has a disheartening
tendency to give way before the baser instincts of
the clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>Alaric set off for Government House in a state of
mind more angelic than comfortable. He felt as if
the backbone had gone out of him with the wickedness,
and his good resolutions were less easy to
carry than his usual self-satisfaction. Nevertheless
it was a beautiful mood, and as genuine as any other
while it lasted. He found that the Administrator
had slept out at China Town at the house of the
Town Warden. This was disturbing, and the impenetrable
reserve of Mr. Halton’s manner when
they encountered each other for a few moments did
not tend to soothe matters. Ally felt that to await
he knew not what, and try to work, tended towards
temporary insanity. At half-past eleven he ordered
his pony, and rode down into Port Victoria.</p>

<p>There was no sign of disturbance there, but he
felt that he could better have faced the town in
ruins, and the coloured population howling and
dancing the “Cannab Hari-kari,” which is a dance
of death, than the solitary figure of Evelyn Gregory
which haunted his imagination. Why had the Administrator
slept out at China Town? What was
going on?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>He lounged into the club, the fret of his nerves
making the click of the billiard balls a torture.
Two men were listlessly playing in the ugly bare
room, where the sun beat past the stoep and
through the glassless window slits. Ally watched
the game for a few minutes, and then his restlessness
drove him across the landing into the reading-room
where no one ever read. Last month’s papers
still lay on the table, and a solitary member was
writing at one of the neglected tables. Ally almost
beat a retreat at sight of the square shoulders and
dark head shot over with grey. No other man in
Key Island wore and kept his collars as high and
clean as the officer in command of the troops.
With the temperature at 90° in the shade Major
Churton was as coolly immaculate in glossy linen
as if he were in Bond Street, and where lesser men
succumbed to turned-down collars and porous shirts,
his were triumphantly starched.</p>

<p>“Hulloa, Major!” Ally said, with an inward
flinching from the encounter.</p>

<p>“Hulloa, Lewin!” The O.C.T. turned his hard
brown face, and there was a twinkle in his bold
eyes. “Got home all right last night, eh?”</p>

<p>A reaction of relief met the twinkle, in Ally’s
facile nature. “By Jove! I was drunk!” he said,
laughing, as he dropped into a chair by the Major’s
side. “My mouth feels like a sponge to-day. Did
I gas much? I owe Mrs. Churton an apology for
such an exhibition in her house.”</p>

<p>“You were a bit on. Nothing to hurt—unless
your pony suffered! You went down that hill like
greased lightning. I had no idea the brute had it
in him—Polo knocks their feet about as a rule.”</p>

<p>“Snapshot took me home—I certainly didn’t
take him. By the way, have you heard anything
of any native trouble?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was a scare, I believe. Gregory sent
up a message that we must be ready to turn out, in
the middle of the night, and rode to China Town
afterwards. Nothing came of it, I presume—at
least we have heard nothing more.”</p>

<p>“My wife got wind of it. I haven’t seen the
Administrator.” Ally’s eyes were still troubled for
all the easy assurance of the Major’s tone.</p>

<p>“Of course there may be a row brewing at China
Town,” he said. “Even going on. We shan’t
hear till it’s over, according to Mr. Gregory’s usual
methods. I think myself it was a false alarm.”</p>

<p>“There’s a telephone from the barracks to Burton’s
house, isn’t there?” said Ally. “They may
have heard something up at Maitso.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“All right, I’ll ask Di.” The Major rung up and
curtly demanded to be connected with his house.
After the usual trying delay Ally heard him say,
“Oh, that you, Di?” and waited breathlessly.</p>

<p>“No,” he remarked after a few brief questions
and imaginable answers. “No news,—Di,” his
mouth was again at the tube—“Lewin is here. All
the better for last night’s temperance meeting!
What?—Oh, Di wants you to come and lunch.”</p>

<p>Now was Ally’s good angel to fail him. He
thought of the limp feeling that self-abasement gave
him, and of how it would certainly season his luncheon
with Chum’s uncomplaining face opposite. He
thought also, with a sense of injury, that she took
his one excess very seriously, and that Churton
himself made light of it. If he went to Maitso
Diana would by no means have a chastening and
depressing influence. Hang it! he had eaten humble
pie enough for one morning, and been wretched
into the bargain. No doubt he should have another
bad quarter of an hour with Gregory; he
would not be miserable from choice.</p>

<p>“All right—please say I shall be very pleased, if
she is so charitable as to forgive last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she will look on that with indulgence I
have no doubt!” said Churton with some cynicism.
“We are none of us total abstainers that we can
accuse each other. Have a whiskey on the strength
of that confession, Lewin!”</p>

<p>When Alaric rode up through the logwood
screen, and pulled rein before the O.C.T.’s quarters,
Mrs. Churton came forth to meet him with a
friendly handshake, and no reference to the advance
of last night. She was a skilful woman. The
Major had come up before, so Diana had already
heard of the supposed alarm, and guessed a good
deal of Ally’s part in it. She drew the rest of the
story from him, new-coloured with the self-defence
that had been growing on him all day, and was
loud in her scorn of Gregory’s eccentricities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“He would like to turn the troops out now and
then on a false scent, to prove their smartness,” she
declared. “The men will mutiny next, if he sends
any more such orders to Maitso, and then he will
revel in a new row. He’s like that—Bute was stationed
with him once before. There’s literally
nothing in it but his usual fuss, and love of worrying
a situation to rags. Gregory’s a Prairie dog,
and Halton’s a cat—you can’t trust what either of
them says or does.”</p>

<p>“It was unfortunate that he took a fit of it last
night,” Ally admitted, but he felt comforted, and
Mrs. Churton’s mental touch upon his nerves was
more soothing, for the moment at any rate, than
his wife’s. He lingered on and on through the
afternoon, and though he shunned actual stimulant
he took many mental whiskies and sodas to keep
himself up. By the time he rode home again to
dinner his repentance of the morning had changed
into a state of injury that the Administrator should
raise false alarms, and upset a peaceful community.
No more was known of Mr. Gregory’s movements,
save that he had returned to Government House,
and still Port Victoria was quiet. It was obviously
a false alarm and a fad of the man in power, and
with a peculiar transposition of mind Captain Lewin
no longer felt that he was the injurer in failing his
chief at a crucial moment, but rather the injured
party in that Mr. Gregory had chosen the one evening
when he was—er—not up to the mark, to make
demands upon him. The elasticity of his conscience
was only equal to his capacity for avoiding unpleasant
truth.</p>

<p>Poor Chum! she was writing her new creed on
sand, and when she saw her teaching briefly reflected
on the surface of his mind, she thought that
it was permanent, and did not realise her own
disaster.</p>

<p>The Commissioner, in company with Mrs. Arthur
White and the Colonial Treasurer, was booked for
England in the next steamer that called at Key
Island. The mail came in once a month, but
occasionally an alteration of route would bring lesser
boats to the great coaling-station as well as the
cruisers, and Mr. Halton plainly said that he would
go in a tin kettle of a tramp rather than wait longer
than was necessary. His work being finished, the
Commissioner found no reason for lingering. There
was indeed a sting in Mr. Halton’s secret consciousness
that made Key Island the more distasteful.
His rides and walks and dilettante attendances on
Mrs. Lewin were no more, for he was superseded
by a stronger personality and writhed to face the
failure of his life in a new form. Something of the
feline nature that Diana Churton had bluffly discerned
was uppermost in him also, and he waited
for a mental pounce since he was no longer purring
under a soft hand. A small man is infinitely more
dangerous to irritate than his brother of a larger
nature, because he deals with details, and the trivialities
that go to make up tragedies are his province.
Halton was waiting, though not consciously, to
avenge himself for the fact that he had allowed the
Administrator to displace him with Mrs. Lewin, and
act cavalier in an uncouth method of his own; and
there was no weak spot in their armour that could
have escaped him. But Chum, having nothing to
conceal, was not a remunerative study, and the
Commissioner fretted in vain until the rains came
down and blotted out Port Victoria for a space during
which he lost even the contemplation of his annoyance,
for when the Heavens open the social life
is paralysed.</p>

<p>September brought back the sunshine, and the
Gilderoys gave a picnic. Being the herald of renewed
amusement, it had an air of festivity that
most like entertainments lacked in their deadly
monotony. Every one went, from Maitso out to
Mitsinjovy, and Mrs. Lewin put on her last new
muslin gown and looked at herself in the glass with
mingled satisfaction and regret. She had ridden
and danced and picnicked through the remainder of
her big trunks in the last six months, for muslin is
perishable and silk goes rotten in those latitudes;
and Key Island knew the very pattern of her laces
save this last white wonder with its unutterable
frills and the grace of fancy sleeves. Leoline was
a woman whose figure gave one the idea of one
lovely line swept off harmoniously from throat to
heel. She might wear muslins made on anybody’s
pattern, but they became her own muslins by immediate
association, and followed the fall of her
lissome body as though they loved her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Just come and choose my hat, Ally,” she called
through the dressing-room door, and Alaric’s broad
shoulders and smooth head followed her summons
dutifully. There was no outward difference between
husband and wife; the same easy relations
existed between them that made Mrs. Lewin’s nickname
of “Chum” typical, the same surface confidence
that caused Ally to staunchly assert to Mrs.
Churton that his married life was entirely satisfactory,
and he himself a beast. The qualification
marked the advance of their intimacy. But in her
heart Mrs. Lewin knew that she was altering; some
new strong development was taking place in the
very fibres of her nature, and the transformation
was a painful process to herself at any rate. It was
even a different face that she saw in the glass as Ally
looked over her shoulder and condemned her choice.</p>

<p>“Not that chiffon thing, Chum, surely. Aren’t
you going to wear a habit?”</p>

<p>“It’s too hot. Besides, I wish to leave a good
impression on Mr. Halton’s mind, and this is his
last festivity. He leaves next week, and takes the
memory of my muslin with him. Isn’t it pretty?”</p>

<p>“Damfino! as the <i>Pink’un</i> used to say—or was it
the <i>Referee</i>? It’s new too, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“My last. Why don’t you like that hat? Will
my Panama do?”</p>

<p>“That’s better. Who will ride with you, Chum?
Halton?”</p>

<p>“Major Churton, I think. With a possible reversion
to Brissy.”</p>

<p>“Why not Gregory’s Powder? Think of my
interests!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“He is not coming with us, but will turn up at
our destination. He has business that will keep
him down at the office until later,” said Mrs. Lewin
without hesitation over the Administrator’s plans,
for she knew them, and knew also deeper reasons
for them, which she did not tell Ally—reasons that
fed the activity of her mind, and to which she
listened with the faithfulness of a tried friend. For
when Gregory laid the heavy weight of his confidence
gradually upon her, he bound her with a chain
whose iron links she hardly felt more than silken as
yet.</p>

<p>Ally accepted her information as more infallible
than an official telegram. “The O.C.T. has his
innings first then,” he added. “Hurry, Chum! I
told them to saddle up.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin thrust a last fierce hatpin into her
Panama, and put up her hand to settle the hairpins
at her neck. It was four o’clock, and they were
due at the rendezvous at half-past, for this was a late
picnic which began in the afternoon and ran on into
nightfall. Such excursions can be planned for two
periods of the day—early morning, or when the sun
is losing its power, but between those hours lies the
Miroro, when no white man may work or play. A
morning picnic sets out before seven, breakfasts up
on the hills, and buries itself in the heart of the
woods during the day’s heat, emerging again at four
for the return to dinner and iced drinks; but it
means a long strain on the endurance of the guests’
attraction for each other, and the Gilderoys were
wise in their generation and chose the shorter
method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>At the foot of Maitso the Lewins fell in with
Halton on his way from Government House, and
Brissy Nugent hot from a canter from Mitsinjovy,
where he had been lunching. The four ponies
turned sturdily to the ascent, and Mrs. Lewin
looked at the streaked flanks of Ally’s mount, and
thanked Heaven for the blanket under her saddle,
for Liscarton’s wet sides did not agree with her
frills. There had been, to her secret amusement, a
brief struggle between Halton and Nugent as to
who should ride beside her, and the soldier’s more
brazen tactics had won the coveted place. Brissy
was not thin-skinned, and that Halton shrugged
his shoulders mentally, and classified him as still
an unlicked cub, did not trouble him so much as it
would have done to be proved the weaker man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin laughed silently, and as usual found
reason for enjoyment in her immediate present.
Afterwards it seemed as if every detail of that day
were cruelly impressed on her memory, and she
never could forget one. Even the garrison jokes
that Brissy told her in doubtful taste, and at which
she had learned the futility of frowning, remained
in her mind long after things she would fain have
kept had drifted from her. She could remember
the very smell from the vegetation which had overgrown
the road during the recent rain, and turning
in her saddle to look down and see the satin blue
bay and the roofs of the crazy little town, whose
zinc shone like a glare of silver in the sunshine.
Beyond Mitsinjovy the Left Gate stood out like a
vast sentinel, shutting out the sea and the horizon,
but from Maitso Hill they could only see the cone
of the Right Gate rising over their own position.
Below them in the harbour the great walls of coal
looked nothing but toy-mounds and black lines,
and the mass of shipping was but a detail in the
picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Often as she had seen that view Mrs. Lewin was
vaguely conscious of seeing it afresh that day, and
the row of ravenalas outside the Churtons’ quarters,
too, struck her as they never had before, while
there seemed a new suggestion that she could not
grasp in the two mounted figures themselves, waiting
motionless in the logwood shade. Diana was
at her best in the saddle, but the Major, who could
have ridden down any man present, looked too
large for a Key Island pony. Even at the moment
Leoline Lewin wondered that she noticed these
things, and seemed possessed of a novel alertness,
a keener sense of observation than ever before, as
though her mental life had quickened. She always
thought of the Gilderoys’ picnic as the last occasion
on which she wore muslin appropriately. She liked
to be in sympathy with her gowns, and she never
again felt the adequate frivolity for the dainty frills
she laid aside that night. Life seemed to have gone
too deep for muslins from that time forth—a foolish
fancy, but one that made the successful little frock
something of a relic.</p>

<p>“How are you, Chum? The Gilderoys are
waiting at the top of the hill,” Diana called out
strongly. “Half the Station is up there already.
Wait a minute—here comes the Denver girl and
Gurney.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin looked at Major Churton, and sat
still.</p>

<p>“An invitation with R. S. V. P. in the corner,”
said the Major succinctly to himself, and went
straight to his goal in characteristic fashion. “Do
I ride with you, Mrs. Lewin?”</p>

<p>“I will trust you to go first!” said Chum gaily.
“There will be no riding with any one if I know
the path we are taking. The ponies slide down on
their tails the other side of Maitso, for I am sure we
are going over the Pass and towards Rano.”</p>

<p>“The Gilderoys are fools if they do,” he said, as
they fell into the procession side by side. “Do you
know what Rano means, by the way?”</p>

<p>“I am not quite ignorant, Major! It means
water in Malagasy, and is given to that range of
hills because of the many springs there—have I
learned my geography lesson rightly? How lovely
the Rano Falls are, by the way! We rode out
there just before the rains.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they will be rather more than lovely
just now! Does the name suggest nothing to your
mind?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“You think the floods will be up?” Mrs. Lewin
asked startled.</p>

<p>“I think the Rano District will probably be impassable
just now, but we will see.” His keen eyes
fell on the couple in front of them, who were Mr.
Gurney and Miss Denver, and he laughed. “That
young lady is a puzzle to the garrison,” he said.
“The women cannot decide if she is a bad lot or
only a little fool.”</p>

<p>“It is her people’s fault. They let her ride about
with the boys stationed here up to twelve at night,
and she spends half her time at Mitsinjovy with
Mrs. Clayton. What can you expect? Of course
people talk. But I think she is quite capable of
taking care of herself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. This affair with Gurney outshines
her former little peccadilloes. She has the
worried air of a girl who has been kissed!”</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for knowing
such things!” retorted Chum quickly. “Perhaps
they are engaged. I know nothing of Mr.
Gurney beyond his voice. He may be all right.”</p>

<p>“Or she may be all wrong! I would solve the
mystery in three minutes—if I were a bachelor.
As things are I do not feel inclined to help to
satisfy public curiosity.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like you nearly so well when you talk
scandal,” said Mrs. Lewin frankly. “And you so
very seldom do it that it jars the more. The girl is
not able to defend herself either. Don’t let us attack
her without cause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>There had been ample cause, in so far as a
foundation for gossip went, and she knew it in her
own mind, even while she defended a fellow-woman.
It flashed across her, with a sense of absolute
wonder, that she could not imagine such a position
as Miss Denver’s—a girl accepted in the social
world of the place, asked to people’s houses, and
spoken of by men as Major Churton had spoken!
Leoline Lewin could not quite realise the tone of
mind in Beatrix Denver, if she could allow herself
to be handled, not by one man only, but by many,
if report spoke truly. She herself had never been
kissed by any man until her engagement, and felt
that she would have a certain shyness in the admission
after other women’s avowed experience. It
seemed rather immature, somehow. And yet the
mere thought of familiarity, even in her present
assured position, appeared an impossibility to her
sense of self-valuation. Of course she could not
soil her own self-respect by such a thing, though she
kept her charity for those who were less particular.
Last week, for instance, Di Churton had told her
that the very Mrs. Clayton, who was Miss Denver’s
chief ally at the Mitsinjovy Garrison, had got the
new boy from Natal in tow. He was rather a nice
youth named Rennie, as Mrs. Lewin knew him,
with little harm as yet in his twenty-one years; but
his education had begun in earnest.</p>

<p>“He runs after Mrs. Clayton everywhere,” Diana
declared. “She takes him home after the dances,
and he unlaces her gowns for her. Brissy Nugent
told me so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“What a pity he didn’t stay with the first battalion
in Natal,” was all Mrs. Lewin had said. But in
her own mind she drew a line of demarcation between
herself and Mrs. Clayton as unconsciously
pharisaical as though they were of different castes.
She was thinking of this now, as she rode over to
Maitso, in the wake of Mr. Gurney and Miss
Denver, and her mood was tolerant because she
was too clear-brained to take a narrower position.
These people did not really matter in hers and
Ally’s lives; their vulgarity need not affect her,
though she lived in touch with them for a period.
By-and-by they would drop out of her existence,
and she would pass on to something cleaner,
unsmutched.</p>

<p>On the crest of the hill they joined the rest of
the party, which had become gradually augmented,
so that between twenty and thirty ponies turned off
to the right in single file, and followed a precipitous
path into the hills. A rough cart, borrowed from
the garrison, and drawn by six stamping, vicious
mules, had gone on ahead with the provisions, by a
longer but less dangerous route. As Mrs. Lewin
had predicted, the ponies had to slide when they
could not walk, and the descent into the next valley
was like a winding stair. To the right the steep
precipice fell sheer down to a flat green bottom
overgrown with logwood and guava—what the
Planters called “dirty land,” because it had not
been “cleaned” for sugar-cane or banana. The
path was so slight a track that Major Churton, riding
in front of Chum, had often to push a way for
her through the eager vegetation. Above the cleft
hills and the valley smiled the blue sky, washed
clean by the rains, and from all sides rose the breath
of the still moist earth.</p>

<p>“This is like riding in a vapour bath,” said Mrs.
Lewin, gasping a little, as the cavalcade emerged
from the trees for a moment and met the freer air
of the hillside. “Major Churton, you were right—the
streams are in flood!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Her exclamation was echoed by a cry of dismay
from the vanguard of the party, for the curve of the
hill had revealed the impassable volume of water to
them. A regular cascade, which in dry weather
was nothing but a shallow stream, was tearing down
the hill at a lower level, and cutting off the valley
land from their advance. The string of ponies
stopped, and there ensued an argument which was,
of course, shouted up and down the hill as to a
change of route. Here and there a pony fretted on
the bit, and brought his hind legs dangerously near
the edge of the track; once a woman shrieked—it
was Miss Denver’s voice, pitched to an hysterical
tone that made Mrs. Lewin’s pulses leap with sudden
dread for her—and an occasional “Woa, boy!”
“Steady, mare!” showed that somebody’s mount
resented the delay. It struck Mrs. Lewin how
strange the string of ponies must look from below,
dotted along the hillside, and she laughed—she remembered
that, too, afterwards as something uncanny.
There are days on which we seem to have
been too prodigal of laughter, and to have squandered
it for little reason.</p>

<p>“Well, we must ride on and get somewhere,”
said Mrs. Gilderoy’s exasperated voice at last.
“There’s a way round; we must take that, and
follow the cart.”</p>

<p>“But I told Mr. Gregory the short cut!” protested
her husband blankly. “He will be sure to
come this way. Will he think of the other road?”</p>

<p>“He must, unless he is an arrant fool,” said Mrs.
Gilderoy, with refreshing candour, and no respect
for the representative of the British Government.
“No one can cross that stream without getting wet
to the waist. We must ride on. You don’t want
to wait until he turns up, I suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>Some echo of the altercation passed down the
line of riders and troubled the air around Mrs.
Lewin. She said nothing, but a new silence seemed
to have fallen upon her as Liscarton at last pricked
his ears and followed his leader with obvious satisfaction.
There was no fear that any one who knew
the country as Gregory did would attempt impossible
feats; the probability was that he might grasp the
situation much sooner than they had done, and, not
knowing what they had decided, turn round and go
home. Mrs. Lewin’s mind felt a sudden blank; she
was looking forward to meeting him to-day, after
an absence of nearly a week, to catch some hint of
his plans that would not yet be public property. It
was still a matter of some scornful marvel to Leoline
Lewin that every one round her openly lamented
their lot in being bound to Key Island, for she did
not realise that her own vitality was being kept up
by a vivid interest. She was living much more
actively in a mental fashion than she had ever done
in her life before, and the island itself, that she
thought the object round which her forces gathered,
was in reality only a background. But as yet she
felt no hint of danger.</p>

<p>The party camped out at last on the bank of the
very stream which had hindered their progress, and
which had given them an extra half-hour’s ride.
The cart was awaiting them, and the men tethered
the ponies and helped outspan, while the women
laid the cloth. There was no kettle to boil, or tea
to make, as in a cooler climate; but the ice had
stood the journey well, and the soda-water and
mangoes came on as cold as if served at Government
House. Mrs. Lewin seated herself on a fallen
tree with Major Churton’s handkerchief spread over
it as a safeguard for her frills, and fell to swizzling
tinned butter with milk in the interests of the company.
At her feet Brissy, in an attitude as condensed
as a monkey’s, was slicing salad with dangerous
activity. The group was gathered on open
ground beyond the absolute tangle of wood which
clothed the hillside, and which was still reeking from
the rains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“Pass the spiders, please!” said Chum absently,
her eyes on the back of Captain Nugent’s flat head,
where the black hair curled crisply. He looked up
with a laugh in the young eyes that had seen too
much of this marvellous universe, and his white
teeth flashed under his moustache.</p>

<p>“You’re dreaming, Mrs. Lewin!”</p>

<p>For once Chum’s control of her blood failed her,
and she flushed a little, conscious that he told the
truth. Her thoughts were with Gregory and his
probable prudence in turning back.</p>

<p>“It was appropriate, anyhow!” she retorted,
shaking a huge specimen off her skirts. “That’s
not a tarantula, is it?”</p>

<p>“No; common or garden bug, I think. Let’s
put it on Miss Denver’s shoulder and hear her
scream!”</p>

<p>“No, Captain Nugent! Stop!” A sharp memory
of the hysterical quality of Miss Denver’s cry
on the hillside made Chum the more imperious.
Even in her own mind she did not form the fear
that a very little would upset the girl’s balance to
make men suspicious of she knew not what; all
she felt was that Miss Denver was not in a state of
nerves for the endurance of spiders. There might
be nothing in it, but she remembered with faint
disgust Major Churton’s broad comment, “She has
the worried look of a girl who has been kissed.”
Mrs. Lewin dropped the subject, and the spider together,
with distaste. Her mental attitude grew a
little contemptuous.</p>

<p>The next instant she had risen silently to her feet
with a nearer and more bitter interest. Some one
had said, “Have a cého, Ally?”—and she threaded
her way through the chattering crowd round the
table-cloth to the three men standing apart by the
tethered ponies, without haste, and with a complete
appearance of her errand being her own need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Ally, do get me some soda-water!” said her
voice behind her husband, as he vacillated on the
brink of consent. “I can’t wait for our meal to be
ready, I’m so thirsty. And don’t put anything
but ice into it; it’s too hot.”</p>

<p>Her candid eyes met his without a shadow of
reproach; yet he coloured ever so slightly, and
shook his head at the man who had suggested
cého. As he halved the soda-water between them,
Chum felt the old humiliation sweep back over her
with fresh force. Who was she to think herself
and Ally above these neighbours of theirs? With
this ugly possibility always dodging her steps, she
was a woman who dared not leave her husband to
judge for himself, but was forced to risk an interference
that might be rightly interpreted at any
moment! She stood there in dispirited silence,
beautiful in her summer gown, but with earnest
eyes that seemed out of place above the dainty
muslin; and for one mad moment she could have
cursed the weakness of the man beside her which
had spoiled her ideal.</p>

<p>And it was just as she turned from him to save
suspicion of her errand, that a sound of welcome
arose from the group round the table-cloth.</p>

<p>“When did you turn up?”—“How wet you are?
You must have swum the stream!”—“There’s a
compliment for you, Mrs. Gilderoy—nothing would
keep him away!”—“Well, you always were a man
who surmounted difficulties!”</p>

<p>It was Gregory, and his high riding boots were
dripping with water; but he laughed at the idea
of cold. The pony took the stream at a point he
knew of, he said; there was no danger—only a
ducking, to which he was used. He had been
riding all through the rains, and forded worse
floods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>He was standing as Mrs. Lewin came back to
the group, and remained so until she had sat down;
then he took a seat near her, but rather behind her
back, so that they could hardly be called companions.
It would have been difficult to talk to her
indeed, and she directed her conversation rather to
Halton, who was facing her at a little distance.
His brown eyes were very constantly on her face,
and she parried their sentimentality with vague
distrust. His departure was lending a new meaning
to their old intimacy, and she had no room for it in
her present life. Her fear for Ally, and her desire
to hear if Gregory had any news, kept her mind at
sufficient stretch. She enjoyed the mental activity
in some strange fashion, in spite of the thread of
pain running through it; but her increasing appetite
for power was not fed by the sentimental half-tones
of her relations with Halton.</p>

<p>As the conversation grew more general she was
conscious of listening for a whisper behind her.
Miss Denver’s laugh was loud above the rest.
Some one challenged Hamilton Gurney to sing,
and he affectedly refused for the sake of being
pressed, but the voice he wanted did not join in the
appeal. Mrs. Lewin was not conscious that they
were urging him to anything in fact, for through
the babel the Administrator had leaned forward and
asked her for more bread and butter. She passed it
back to him, and as he took it his voice breathed a
whisper in her ear—</p>

<p>“I have heard from Capetown.”</p>

<p>She dared not turn her head, but her nerves
seemed strung as if by a strong stimulant. He
folded the bread and butter deliberately, while she
still held the plate, and his voice went on rapidly—</p>

<p>“They have given me <i>carte blanche</i> to do as I
please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Gurney had given up the hope of any persuasion
coming from Mrs. Lewin, and as he really
wanted to sing, he screwed up the melancholy
banjo which he had sent on in the cart, and twanged
an accompaniment. The first notes fell on deaf
ears as far as Leoline was concerned, for her mind
buzzed with possibilities. She had never dreamed
that the Capetown Government would put such
power into a man’s hands which the Home Authorities
had carefully tied. But she forgot how small a
dot Key Island appeared to the larger State, already
worried with its own affairs. <i>Carte blanche</i> meant
that Gregory might get to the root of the hashish
trouble by burning the crops, or any other drastic
measure, and this would be followed by probable
consequences for which she knew some of his plans.
He was nearer to the grip of his tiny kingdom, at
which he aimed, than he had been two months ago.
Mrs. Lewin drew her breath as if something had
almost taken it away. She was excited and roused,
and her blood was on fire....</p>

<p>Then Gurney’s voice stole in on her attention,
loosening the restraint of her will-power still more
in its subtle sweetness. Between the rush of two
unusual emotions she felt bewildered, and clutched
blindly after her usual self-control. Her eyes
threatened to fill with ridiculous tears, and half-a-dozen
men and women would see and misinterpret
them. She flung herself a little into the shadow of
a tree, leaning back with her hand on the ground
behind her to support herself. It enabled her
to turn her face so that she hoped it was partly
masked.</p>

<p class="noindent">Something hotter than tears seemed to flash across
Leoline Lewin’s eyeball; the universe stood still,
soundless and sightless, then rushed on with
clangor, and drowned every sound save the little
trivial song which still tinkled so loudly in her
stunned soul, ... for Evelyn Gregory had
leaned back also, and laid his hand heavily over
hers as it rested on the ground, out of sight of every
one in the group. During the shock of the first
five seconds she thought that he had done so unconsciously,
and that the movement had been as
natural as her own. She dared not move for fear
of making him conscious, and waited for him to
remove the heavy pressure that she might slide her
own away, and never refer to it.... The
seconds went on and on, each that passed accentuating
a new beautiful terror and conviction in her
mind. He did not move. Human flesh cannot
press human flesh and be unconscious for so long.
Her blood leapt to the revelation that they were
man and woman, and felt, too, the humiliation of
knowing that they were not sexless as friends.</p>

<p>Chum drew her knees up and clasped her hands
round them as though she would gather her forces
together; but as she did so her eyes fell on the back
of her hand, where a faint red flush marred the white
skin. It told tales of the rough pressure she had
endured to her maddened mind, and she dropped it
again to the ground—but this time out of reach—beside
her. She glanced round the ring of faces
and found no answering consciousness there. They
were all trying the echo—shouting nonsense up the
valley on the quiet evening air. She looked at
Halton, and saw that he was looking down, apparently
the most abstracted person present. But
with a pang of fear she wondered if she would have
read knowledge in the eyes veiled by his drooped
lids. She was frightened, not only for herself, but
for that other behind her, her woman’s intuition
recognising the danger that lay under Halton’s
quiet, and with characteristic courage she walked
straight up to her danger to look it in the face.</p>

<p>“Are you going to ride home with me, Mr. Halton?”
she contrived to say, as the ponies were saddled
up for the return.</p>

<p>“If you have made no other arrangement?” he
said tentatively. There was nothing to take hold
of in the words, because Major Churton had ridden
with her before, and might claim the privilege again.
But she caught a covert insinuation and scored up
an unpaid grudge against him.</p>

<p>“I am not using you to escape an unwelcome
cavalier!” she said, as if accepting his own
idea.</p>

<p>“What an unpleasant suggestion! I shall be
wondering all the way which man is thirsting for
my blood.”</p>

<p>“It would be a better compliment if you took it
for granted that they were all envious. You are
out of practice, Mr. Halton.”</p>

<p>“I have had none of late.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; use the present opportunity on
my gown!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“It is charming, of course!” he said, as he arranged
the blanket over Liscarton’s streaked shoulders,
and pulled the girth tight. “And no other
lady would have dared to risk it on a hot pony,
would they?”</p>

<p>“I told my husband that I wished to leave a good
impression on your mind!”</p>

<p>“Really? But why struggle for the inevitable?
I am all the more flattered though, of course. It is
not every day that a lady makes herself smart for
my especial benefit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t!” said Chum, as she lifted herself
easily into the saddle. “Smart is now a word
sacred to the middle classes, to whom it means inferior
silks and strings of imitation beads!”</p>

<p>“So bad as that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, really. And the same degree of cheapness
is expressed in the word ‘clever’—its mental
equivalent. Perhaps on the whole it is best summed
up in the draper’s ideal of one and elevenpence
halfpenny!”</p>

<p>“I am so glad you did not say three farthings!”</p>

<p>“We never have such things now,” sighed Mrs.
Lewin. “There <i>is</i> a farthing, of course—but they
are rapidly becoming relics. You get a packet of
very bad pins, or a pencil that you particularly don’t
want, for the odd number.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>His laugh sounded like the earlier terms of their
acquaintance, and she congratulated herself on her
stroke of policy in reannexing him for this occasion.
Never once had her eyes met Gregory’s since that
revelation during Gurney’s song, and she had not
spoken to him. As they rode back through the
falling dusk she fenced with Halton as of old, retreating
and advancing like the figure of a mental
quadrille, and was surprised to find it tedious. Had
the stronger personality that was even now shadowing
her made the other man seem slight, or was
Halton only attractive to a certain point, after
which he could only repeat himself? It seemed to
her that realities had superseded the dilettantism
of their brain flirtations, and made them a tiresome
waste of time.</p>

<p>As they rode through Port Victoria, and turned
off on the Government House road, she missed Ally
and learned that he had ridden home with his chief,
and would come on to the bungalow afterwards,
doubtless.</p>

<p>“I saw them turn up the avenue; they were in
front of us,” Halton said quietly. “Did you not
see them?”</p>

<p>She thought he looked at her.</p>

<p>“I don’t always see my husband!” said Mrs.
Lewin adroitly. “Life would be so fatiguing if one
could not sometimes close one’s eyes, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Or substitute another object?” said Halton, as
they drew rein. “The mail comes in to-morrow,
and I expect to leave in her the day after, Mrs.
Lewin. But I hope this is not good-bye?”</p>

<p>“I am coming to see you off, of course! I will
bring you one of Ally’s pocket handkerchiefs.”</p>

<p>“To wave, or to weep in?”</p>

<p>“Whichever you prefer. Personally, I want to
murder people who weep over me; but if you like
it, I will imitate the late rains.”</p>

<p>“I would not cost you a tear!” he said, with a
sudden note of feeling in his voice that vaguely
surprised her. “If your future were in <i>my</i> hands,
there would be very little fear for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>He rode away into the darkness without any
further farewell, while Mrs. Lewin pondered his
words with a fresh misgiving. When Ally came in
half-an-hour later, he told her—as he usually did
when it was so—that Halton had been speaking of
her.</p>

<p>“I hope he was admiring me!” said Chum
brightly. “But he could hardly do less—to you.”</p>

<p>“He said you were very clever!” said Ally
doubtfully. Who likes his wife to be called clever?</p>

<p>“One and elevenpence halfpenny!” murmured
Chum absently. “I did hope I was worth two
shillings, anyway.”</p>

<p>“And sma——”</p>

<p>“Ally, if you say smart <i>too</i>, I shall have Mr.
Halton up for libel!” said Mrs. Lewin indignantly.</p>

<p>Ally laughed. “Gregory’s Powder didn’t say
anything,” he remarked. “I don’t think you’ve
made much impression there, in spite of your
earnest efforts, you know, Chum.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin looked down absently at the back of
her hand, almost as if she expected to see something
there; but her real answer came later, as she
kissed her husband and said good-night.</p>

<p>“Ally,” she said slowly, turning back at the
door, “do you mind? It’s so hot to-night! And
you are restless, and have kept me awake lately!”</p>

<p>Alaric finished his whiskey and soda rather
soberly. “Oh!” he said. “All right. I’ll sleep
in the dressing-room——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>He heard Leoline enter her own room and turn
the key in the lock, and he wondered in his stupid
handsome head that she should so insist on privacy.
Then he cheered up, had another whiskey, and supposed
she had a headache. A man may distrust
his mistress if she locks him out, and knows how to
translate his own inclination to sleep in the dressing-room.
But the <i>tertium quid</i> of his wife’s case
is always a headache.</p>

<p>The restless, tropical night seemed full of wings
to Leoline’s ears as she lay on her back with hands
clasped under her fragrant hair, and her wide eyes
looking up into the bridal fall of the mosquito net.
In spite of being alone she had gained no hint of
sleep, nor had she expected it. The heat was
intense, even though the bungalow was some way
above the town up on the hillside, and the heaviness
of the rains still seemed to hang in the air.
The complaining, vicious note of a mosquito
haunted the safe curtains, through which he could
not find an entrance; and, as if in contempt of him,
Leoline had flung off the covering sheet, and where
the soft frills fell back her white body tempted the
angry insect with sweets out of reach. It would
have been a pity to mark that perfect skin; but
the mosquito thought of his own desire above all
artistic considerations—just as that much higher
creation called Man might do if, for instance, he
wished to feel the pressure of his own hand on
hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin was hardly thinking as the long
hours wore to morning, and the flutter of moths’
wings gave way to that of humming-birds, who
had built their nests below the stoep,—she was
simply suffering. It seemed to her that her mind
was one blind pain and a bewildering humiliation.
For it was not the thing in itself that horrified her—a
man’s hand laid over hers for some sixty
seconds seemed a trivial thing enough—but what
it meant. She who had unconsciously put herself
on a pedestal, found that she had fallen, not by
the unimportant act but by the revelation it had
brought of her own emotions. She had not been
cool under Gregory’s touch; if she had she would
have brushed the incident aside as a thing of no
consequence, tiresome but to be disregarded; her
blood had answered his, and beat in her veins, and
made her whole body thrill and sicken as no touch
had ever done before. A knowledge that she
could no longer deny to herself dismayed her,
showing her this first touch as the prelude to more
that she dared not contemplate. It was the thin
end of the wedge, the passing of a boundary line to
a path that might lead her—anywhere. She knew
it, and in the warm, soft darkness she did not lie to
herself as she might have done in the decent day.
A married woman is somewhat defenceless against
herself, for she is forced to acknowledge her own
emotions, and has legitimised their classification.
While she is unmarried—whether by law or slighter
bonds—she can theorise, but she can always excuse
herself by saying that she does not know the
meaning of her sex. Nor in a certain degree does
she. It is, however, her husband’s useful province
to deprive her of such a defence, and to make her
horribly conscious of the meaning of starting pulses
and too generous blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Ally had once told Chum, with a chuckle, that
she took to married life as a duck takes to water.
And, in truth, she did not quarrel with nature any
more than any other healthy, clear-minded wife
whose womanhood is ripe. But there was a nicety
about her that was content to look on passion as
a thing incidental to married life, but not to be
dwelt upon, and her bodily relations with Alaric
had never seemed to her of so much importance as
those of her mind. There was again a hint of
superiority in this, for she saw other women holding
out grosser inducements to charm than she
professed, and made a somewhat fastidious use of
her physical advantages by contrast.</p>

<p>For once, and quite suddenly, it seemed to her
that this attitude had after all been false. If she
wore her frocks with a daintier grace than other
women, did it not suggest that what lay beneath
was daintier too? She thought with disgust of
Mrs. Clayton’s bodices being actually unlaced;
but her own bodices had been quite as tempting
to the audacity of men’s thoughts, and she had
meant them to be so. It was only that she
promised and did not perform, while other women
enjoyed the fulfilment of their own allurements.
No man could say a word of her as they might of
Beatrix Denver; but how many had envied Ally
to the extent of fancying themselves in his place
for one wicked blissful moment? And she had
regarded that as legitimate, and a rightful compliment
to them both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>Oh, but what did it matter, compared to this new
fire in her veins—this mad possibility of painful
happiness that was surely not sane, for she could
find no reason to excuse it. Every yearning
instinct of her, brain, body, and soul, seemed
drawn out, beyond her power to will to restrain
it, to a man who was not her husband, and who
had not even such attractions as might excuse a
physical passion. She thought of Ally’s handsome
face, and easy, comfortable personality, contrasted
with Evelyn Gregory’s harsh features and difficult
nature. There would be nothing comfortable in a
life with Gregory, unless indeed a woman were so
at one with him as for their two personalities to
harmonise without a discordant note. He would
be overbearing and exacting, but strong both for
himself and her; there came the renewed leap of
heart, as all the woman in her craved for a master.
She was tired of her disillusion, and of being the
one to guide and act both at once. Gregory had
appealed to her through the feeling of reliance
with which he had filled her. There had been the
snare and the excuse, if an excuse were possible
for a feeling which seemed to her outside the pale
of argument.</p>

<p>“What does it matter,” she thought wearily,
“since I am proved a fraud on all accounts. I am
not what I thought I was—all my theories with regard
to myself seem to have been mere vapours to
vanish with the first ray of sun. But I can fight
still—I can—I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>She set her little white teeth, and gripped the pain
as though it were a tangible thing. And then, because
she was just a good girl and no heroine, she
threw aside the mosquito net and knelt down beside
the bed to pray to a God whom she believed had
sent an ugly tragedy into her life, not to take it
away, but to help her to hide it after the fashion of
women. She was ready to trust Him where she no
longer trusted herself, and having certain sturdy
principles born and bred in her, she had not even
the advantage of excusing self-indulgence upon the
plea of possessing the “artistic temperament,” which
is a very convenient back door for immorality to
the modern woman. It generally means lack of
exercise and hysteria; but Leoline Lewin’s digestion
being a good one, she had no claim to such an
immunity from inconvenient virtue.</p>

<p>Towards morning she fell asleep, but not into the
same sound oblivion as on the night when Ally lay
in a drunken slumber next door. She could control
her waking thoughts, but her dreams were cruel,
and were haunted by such forbidden joy as made
her glad when the broad sun struck through the venetian
shutters and brought the sick, hot day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>The mail came in that morning, and all Port Victoria
went down to the harbour to meet it. The
town was cut off from all save chance communication
with the outer world for a whole month, and
so the arrival of news was a greater event than in a
larger colony. The wharf was a rendezvous, therefore,
on mail days, and the U.C.L. officers of the incoming
boat could have laid themselves up with cého
in the first half-hour, if they had accepted all the
hospitality offered them, and drunk the liqueur fast
enough. Leoline rode down to town early, and sat
patiently on Liscarton’s back among the coal-dust
and the smell of fessikh, or salted fish, which is as
the smell of unutterable decay, and believed by
many to be nothing but dried nigger, and high
game at that. The little colony gathered gradually
about her, and for the first time the sameness of the
faces struck her with a kind of horror. She had
met them over and over again, and they had not so
oppressed her; now she realised that there were
only some forty white people in the immediate
neighbourhood to know, and that she must go on
meeting them for all the remainder of the time that
Ally was stationed there, until the social life seemed
like a circle. There were one or two newer faces
out at China Town, or Port Albert, perhaps,—a
Planter or so scattered beyond the Pass or up on
the Tableland; but even these belonged to the same
community. She looked at the blue bay, the forest
of masts, the one big ship at the quay, the line of
ravenalas along the shore with their lifted fans like
spread fingers, the warm wooded hills that shut it
all in,—and Halton’s words returned to her with
meaning for the first time.—</p>

<p>“We are in a rat-trap!”</p>

<p>A sort of terror seized her, a feeling that she
must get away from the dangerous monotony of it
all. She could face and wrestle with the situation
threatening her at the moment, while her senses
were still alert with the shock of her awakening;
but how would it be as the months rolled on, and
time inevitably lessened her sense of danger and
dulled her watchfulness! She began to realise that
Ally had not been all to blame for his weakness,
and that Miss Denver had no other distraction for
her idle days; they might both be of feebler natures
than her own, but at least there were extenuating
circumstances. She could think that with
broader possibilities they might have made a better
fight for it.</p>

<p>“We are in a rat-trap!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>She looked round her slowly, at the familiar figures
in the flaccid sunlight, and wished that she did
not know every face turned to her. The very smile
that came inevitably as their eyes met seemed a
weary proof of having them before her yesterday,
and to-day, and to-morrow. There was Mrs. Gilderoy,
in an old riding skirt that smacked forlornly
of Bond Street long ago, and a limp white shirt;
there was her husband, equally inevitable, in a grey
flannel suit, with a Madras helmet hiding his face
down to the ragged tawny moustache. As if by
common consent they made straight for Leoline,
who was seized with a wild impulse to pull Liscarton
round and ride out of the sameness of the scene.
She even thought she knew the very words they
said before they uttered them.</p>

<p>“How are you, my dear?” Mrs. Gilderoy spoke
first. “Anything left of you from yesterday? I
shall take a month to recover. I always wonder,
after we have exerted ourselves like that to bore
our friends, why we did it. So does Wray; he
thinks he lost several pounds from that ride down
to the valley.”</p>

<p>“I felt it dripping away,” said Captain Gilderoy
in his pleasant voice. “I have lost something
like three stone since I came to this abominable
hole.”</p>

<p>“It was a terribly hot night,” said Chum, striving
for her usual manner by instinct. “I think the heat
increases.”</p>

<p>“It does not vary much in the tropics,” said Mrs.
Gilderoy, shrugging her shoulders. “I have not
been dry for eighteen months, but I am growing
used to it. Oh, how I envy the Commissioner!
Think of going Home, and the East winds, and sitting
on deck to wait for the first shiver!”</p>

<p>“A jacket would be quite an excitement, wouldn’t
it? And I believe it would be a new experience to
catch cold. Do you notice that no one catches
cold here? We go down with influenza, and chills,
and fever, and horrid things like that, but sneezing
is a lost art!”</p>

<p>“You have been out nine months, haven’t you,
Chum, and you are beginning to feel it? You did
not take that view on your arrival, did you? At
first sight the Station strikes you as a merry little
place, where we all wear white clothes and pretend
that we like each other.”</p>

<p>“And by-and-by we realise the coal-dust,” said
Mrs. Lewin, with veiled bitterness. “You are quite
right—one easily gets to feel soiled in Port Victoria!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“I think when the rains come the wet heat oozes
into one’s bones somehow. You will have to go
up to Victoria if you feel limp.”</p>

<p>“We ought to make up a party,” said Captain
Gilderoy. “Mrs. Clayton would join with pleasure,
I am sure, and Miss Denver. They had great
games there last year—some of the men from ‘By-Jovey’
got leave and went too. Have you had
your mail yet? We can sit here in comfort
while Wray goes and gets them for us, if you
like.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Don’t bring my husband’s, though,
please, Captain Gilderoy. He likes to fetch his
mail himself.”</p>

<p>The post-office was close to the wharf, behind a
block of store-houses, where the big firms received
their imports and placed them for unpacking.
Captain Gilderoy disappeared behind a wall of
coal, and Mrs. Gilderoy and Mrs. Lewin sat still on
their ponies in the shade, now chatting to some acquaintance
who had joined them, now watching the
cargo being dumped down into the grit and dirt of
the quay.</p>

<p>“We can go on board as soon as that mess is
cleared off!” said Mrs. Gilderoy, with a nod towards
the bales that would feed her during the next
month. “But it is so uncomfortable while they are
all running about and falling over each other round
the hatches. Mrs. Ritchie Stern is on board. Her
husband’s boat is coming in to-day to coal, she
says, and she followed him in the mail. They will
be here for some days. Captain Nugent is bursting
with excitement, and planning a ball for every night
that they spend here!”</p>

<p>“Heaven help them!” said Chum, laughing.
“What is Captain Stern’s boat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“The <i>Greville</i>, I think.” She dropped her voice
a note lower, and leaned over her saddle. “Have
you heard that there is trouble on the East Coast,
up at Port Cecil?”</p>

<p>“No!” Something in the tone startled Chum,
though the words meant nothing to her. “Port
Cecil!” she repeated vaguely. “Is that——”</p>

<p>“No, not in Key Island at all—on the African
coast, in British East Africa, and dangerously near
the German frontier. I believe it never has been
rightly settled as to whether Port Cecil is British or
German territory. I wish they had handed it over
with Mafia. It would be so much more sensible!
There is nothing officially stated, but a rumour of
trouble has leaked out. The Capetown authorities
have cabled through to our man to send some one
up at once. You see, it is so much nearer than it
would be for them, and it’s a very delicate kind of
mission. Wray calls it handling a meerkat with
boxing-gloves on! We can’t offend the natives,
and we won’t offend Germany for some reason just
now. It’s to be all tact and no soldiers this time.”</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Halton is the right man to go.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly; and as Gregory has his own
little threatened rows to amuse him, I suppose they
think at Capetown that it’s safe to let him use his
own discretion as to who he sends. Otherwise I
should be afraid of his going himself and setting
the country in a blaze, if I were the man above
him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he would do that while the natives
here seem still so unsettled. But what a disappointment
for Mr. Halton! He told me he was longing
to get home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, it’s awful! The town is not only
the Naboth’s vineyard of our coast and Germany’s,
but it is unhealthy. They say the white soldiers
can hardly live there. Do you know that Wray
thinks they will send up the 28th from Natal?”</p>

<p>“Ally’s regiment! But I thought there was to
be no fighting?”</p>

<p>“No; but they must have soldiers in case of accidents,
and they want to treat Port Cecil as separate
from the rest of the Protectorate. It was not
included in the treaty of 1895, or some such bungle,
and so there is always being a row about it. Wray
tried to explain it to me, but I never <i>can</i> understand.
Anyhow, it is a diplomatic mission, and
enough to turn Mr. Halton’s hair grey, unless he
knows something about the place. Has he ever
been in that part?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so; but Mr. Gregory spoke one
day of a friend of his—a man he seems to think
very able—who has been consul, or something of
that sort, there for years. I wonder that the Government
did not leave him to settle matters.”</p>

<p>“My dear Chum, don’t you know that our Government
never does use the man on the spot who
has gained experience and really could manage?
The instant there is trouble they send some one
who has never heard of the place, and is bound to
blunder at first, and they ‘commission him to inquire,’
etc. We are mad on commissions. It’s a
national disease. I think sometimes that it’s a farce
we play to gain them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Here comes Captain Gilderoy,” said Mrs. Lewin
absently. She was wondering if this new billet
would keep Halton longer in Key Island, for she
felt that the sooner he went the safer she should be.
Yet he was emphatically the only man at hand
whom Gregory had to send to Port Cecil, for Arthur
White was no diplomatist, and Major Churton’s
position so strictly military as to make his presence
a menace. Captain Gilderoy handed her two
letters—one from her home, far off in the hunting
county of Leicestershire, and one in the handwriting
of an old school friend, who had since married
a man high in authority, and had a dangerous desire
to dabble in state-craft. She knew of appointments
and the pulling of strings before the <i>Gazette</i> had
ratified them, and her wisdom was a thing that even
her husband sometimes feared. It chanced that
Leoline Lewin opened this letter before her father’s,
read the first few sentences, which were merely a
heading, and suddenly became immersed, to the exclusion
even of the smell of fessikh and the ever-recurring
faces around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“But my real news,” wrote Chum’s school-mate,
“refers to you, or, I hope, will do so if you have
only gained the good-will of your Administrator.
Cyril Ernest has come into the Rignold title, and
that means resigning his commission and going into
Parliament—he was always a politician rather than
a soldier. He was A.D.C. to old Sir Geoffrey
Vaughan, who is a great crony of mine. I met the
old fellow at Victoria House the other night, and
buttonholed him in a corner. Don’t tell me I am
not a good friend, Chum, for I thought of you at
once, and tried to impress Ally’s virtues on him.
He hummed and hawed a little, but he remembered
Ally; he said there were two nice boys to whom
he gave the preference—your husband and Brissy
Nugent, who, I think, was at Sandhurst with him.
I am afraid I belittled Brissy in your interest. It is
so unfortunate that they are stationed at the same
place, for I could gain no absolute promise from Sir
Geoffrey. All he would say was that he would
leave it to Evelyn Gregory to give the casting vote,
and he has written to him unofficially. Weaker
men are fond of leaving the decision with Gregory.
Now, my dear girl, it all depends on you. You
<i>must</i> manage your man in office so that he shall
recommend Ally, and not Captain Nugent. It is a
settled thing that Sir Geoffrey will go to Malta, unless
he has something even better—a home command,
it might be. Don’t believe any one who
talks about the African generals; I know better.
Even my husband is not in my confidence about
the appointment yet, but you may take my word
for it, and I am telling you because it gives you a
start over Mrs. Nugent—I never did like that
woman—and you are on the spot, too, and she is
not. I have only just time to catch the mail,” etc.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin turned the pages breathlessly, and
the lines danced before her eyes. Here were two
appointments confidentially placed in the hands of
the man Government hardly professed to trust; but
she was not thinking of the unofficial way in which
the Empire was really worked, or the incalculable
value of the force which is politely termed “Influence.”
Her personal stake in the matter drove even
the question of the trouble in East Africa out of her
head, though before her friend’s letter she was
keenly interested in it as in some sort concerning
Gregory. She saw only that here was the escape
for which she had prayed, and the old French saying,
that “What a woman wishes, God wishes,” recurred
to her mind like a blessing. Malta or England—the
words spelt rescue, however one read
them. Her eyes followed every line of the great
quiescent liner hungrily, while, in her fevered
fancy, she saw it carrying her out of danger—her
and Ally together—beyond the rat-trap where the
rats were already beginning to menace each other
because they could not get out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Surely Ally’s appointment must be a foregone
conclusion! She had already done what her friend
counselled, in her forethought for the future, and
had gained the ear of the Administrator. In their
increasing confidence she had spoken frankly though
delicately of her husband, and had acknowledged
that she was ambitious for him, and wished him to
rise. And Gregory had sympathised, even though
he might not believe in Ally’s capabilities. Surely
he would help her!</p>

<p>She did not trouble over Brissy much as a rival,
for Evelyn Gregory thought no more of him than
of his A.D.C. Brissy was not the stumbling-block
in the way of success—it was unfortunately Ally
himself who was his own enemy. But forewarned
is forearmed, and she must this time force him to a
strategic management of his chief for both their
sakes. Her very muscles felt tense and braced for
the effort, as she sat in the shade of the coal walls,
mechanically nodding and smiling at the people
round her. As soon as might be she would get out
of all this, and ride home and wait for Ally. They
must talk it over, and arrange the campaign the
instant they could do so without arousing suspicion.
She wondered if her own precious news had “leaked
out” as well as the African appointment; but it
was unlikely. The woman who had told her prided
herself on knowing such secrets long before they
were even private property.</p>

<p>On the further side of the wharf Brissy Nugent
himself was reading stale news from an old paper
with the avidity of a starved dog, while he also
waited to go on board the mail boat; but the
Naval and Military intelligence told him nothing
of his own possible fortune, and in fact he never
dreamed of gaining any advantage from the paper
beyond a passing amusement. He was sitting on
a pile of logwood waiting for shipment in a sailing
vessel, with a Madras helmet spread like an umbrella
over his head and shoulders, side by side with
Clayton of the A.S.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“I see that Bobs was talking to the Sandhurst
Cadets the other day,” said Clayton, turning his
own paper, posted from England a month since,
“and he said it was all nonsense to suppose that no
man can get on in the Army without influence.
My firm conviction is that without influence in the
Army one might as well make up one’s mind to
achieve nothing but the ordinary promotion which
comes with time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the system which should be adopted is to
do away with rewards altogether,” said Nugent
simply. “Either a man does his duty, or he does
not. If he does, well and good. If he doesn’t, then
he ought to be kicked out.” His soulless eyes went
out over the paper he was holding in search of his
acquaintance, and he saluted Miss Denver, who
was passing on her pony, with a flash of white
teeth under his black moustache. He was more
interested in her at the moment than in what he
was saying, albeit it was his honest conviction.</p>

<p>“That’s a beautifully simple creed, Brissy, and I
have no doubt that if it were adopted there would
be fewer of the absolutely useless men who encumber
the Service. They do nothing either one way
or the other; they usually have money, are in no
way dependent on their profession, and care nothing
for it, except in so far as it affords them amusement.
There’s a case not five miles from here!”
he added significantly.</p>

<p>“You mean old Ally Sloper. Yes, I don’t suppose
he’ll ever do much. But, then, he don’t need
to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Exactly!” said Clayton with frank bitterness.
“And because he hasn’t got it in him to push himself,
a beneficent Providence has given him friends
in office, and a wife with brains and ambition.
That woman means him to get on, Brissy, and she
could make something even of you or me.”</p>

<p>“I saw her here a moment ago,” said Brissy, to
whom abstract references always suggested actual
things. “She was on Liscarton, by the coal heap
over there. She seems to have gone now!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin’s place was indeed empty, but he did
not know in what relation that affected him. For
Chum had gone home, and when Captain Lewin
appeared among the chattering crowd on the wharf,
he learned from the Gilderoys that she had left a
message for him to the effect that heat and coal-dust
threatened to transform her to a nigger, but
he would find her cleaned and awaiting him at
luncheon time. Ally, jocund and social, moved
among his friends, as pleased to be off work as a
school-boy out of school.</p>

<p>“Chum’s off colour a bit, I think,” he said confidentially
to Diana Churton. “She couldn’t sleep
last night for the heat.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get out to Vohitra—it’s about time,” said
Di good-naturedly. “I’m thinking of making up
a party. You can’t get back to lunch at the
bungalow, Ally; it’s too late. Come on board the
mail, and see Mrs. Ritchie Stern. The <i>Greville</i> has
just passed the Gates.”</p>

<p>Ally vacillated, and looked at his watch. “Chum
expected me to lunch at home!” he said.</p>

<p>“Send Brissy in your place!” said Di, with a
short laugh. “No, tell Bute; he’s got to ride up to
Government House, and he’ll take a message.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Ally, and his face
cleared to its own gay good-humour, “I’ll telephone;
I can ring up from the post-office. Wait
for me, Di, and we’ll go on board together.”</p>

<p class="noindent">“Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more
hope of a fool than of him!”—<i>Jewish Proverb.</i></p>
</div>


<p>I think it is the Chinese who have a proverb that
says: “To expect one who does not come, to eat
and not to be satisfied, and to work for years and
get no promotion, are three things which are enough
to kill a man.” Mrs. Lewin had been proving the
wearing process of the first clause for a good half-hour,
before the telephone bell rang, and her husband’s
voice informed her that he was detained, and—er—awfully
sorry, but would not be in to lunch.
“I’ll come up later—have you got a headache,
Chum?” said the strong tones, muffled to half their
weight like a ventriloquist’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>The “er” was a fatal hesitation, and struck Mrs.
Lewin’s keenness of perception. Ally had not been
detained by duty as he wished her to imagine—he
was lunching on board the mail boat, catching at
the nearest pleasure as usual, to his own detriment
and hers. For a minute a wave of very human
irritation prompted her to let him go his own way.
Why should she for ever stand between him and
retribution? She was tired, and inclination
prompted her to let the struggle go, and take consequences
as easily and without regret as he did.
Then with another change of mood she saw that
Ally’s lack of purpose was no excuse for her own.
The very things she saw and condemned in him
were a spur to her to be on her own guard. The
danger was hers as well as his—the object to be
gained her own safety too. She could let no chance
go by, and the feeblest of human excuses always is,
“I am no worse than my neighbours.” It all passed
over her conscious mind while she stood with the
little apparatus still in her hands.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve no headache—I’m all right,” she said
quietly. “But come up after lunch, Ally—I want
to see you. It’s important—but don’t say anything
to any one. Tell them I am seedy if you like, and
that you must get back.”</p>

<p>She wondered as she heard his half-uneasy “Yes,
of course I’ll come the minute I can,” if there were
any one standing near him. One could hear too
much in a public place, if one were only near the
instrument. Well, it could not be helped, and after
all they might think it was a private matter—something
contained in her own home mail. But in Key
Island every one’s business is of importance to discuss
for lack of one’s own, and even her own
guarded sentences would have grown to a state
secret before nightfall, had they been overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Ally was so relieved to be easily excused that he
really did as he had promised, and rode up before
three o’clock, feeling a virtuous husband and deserving
of much welcome and something to drink, for
he was really very hot. He brought many invitations
to consider themselves engaged for the next
two days, beginning with a dance that night at the
Wessex Mess, and including a breakfast party and
two luncheons, for the mail boat and the <i>Greville</i>
were both busy in friendly rivalry. The projected
gaiety was driven out of his head, however, by his
wife’s private news, and he was so really engrossed
with the possibility of their removal, that Chum
forgave him his defection from lunch, and came
over and sat on the arm of his chair, while he read
her friend’s letter.</p>

<p>“Great Scot, what luck!” he said with boyish
excitement. “Chum, we must manage it, if you
have to go on your knees to Gregory’s Powder, and
I to lick old Sir Geoffrey’s boots! Malta or a
home station—thank Heaven the old boy always
liked me!”</p>

<p>“Did he like Brissy as well?” said Leoline anxiously,
and without any enmity towards Brissy,
feeling glad of his shortcomings. “Ally, he <i>can’t</i>
have thought Brissy as nice as you!”</p>

<p>“Poor old Bristles! No, I do think I showed up
rather well against him, you know, Chum. Anyhow
it seems to rest with Gregory. What a good
stroke that was of yours to play up to him, old girl!
You always said he was a good man to have behind
you—I think you’re the smartest Chum a fellow
ever married! No, you don’t like that word,
do you—I mean you’re the quickest, and the most
farseeing——”</p>

<p>He broke off to laugh and put his arm round her
as she leaned over his shoulder, giving her a boyish
hug that seemed to take her breath away, for she
freed herself of him with a protest like a cry.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Ally!—let me get up—I can’t breathe!—No,
it’s nothing. Yes, of course we must have the
appointment—it’s all in your hands now.”</p>

<p>“Mine! It’s much better in yours——”</p>

<p>“No!—no!—you must make a good impression,
somehow. I am sure the Administrator likes you
for yourself—every one does. It’s only that you
will shirk, that annoys him. Don’t play tennis
or polo quite so much—try and seem to have
grasped the situation here—I’ll coach you. We
must get away—oh, we must have that appointment!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>She spoke breathlessly, but he was excited also,
and seemed to catch more fire from her. His face
only fell once as he thought of the <i>Greville</i> and
mail boat festivities.</p>

<p>“By Jove! and this was to be a week, too!
Never mind—I’ll give up most of it and stick to
business. You’re quite right, Chum—I’ll be seized
with a savage desire to get things properly settled
up before Halton goes. I would grub in correspondence
and red tape if only it would ensure my
getting out of this beastly island!”</p>

<p>“Don’t overdo it,” said Mrs. Lewin nervously.
“He is so quick to see through people. Ally, I
wonder if he will send Mr. Halton to Port Cecil?
I suppose you’ve heard of that—isn’t it strange that
Mr. Gregory should have the nomination of both
men to these appointments!”</p>

<p>“Oh I don’t care if the whole of East Africa is
put into Halton’s hands, so long as I get the other
show. Think of it, Chum—home leave, food that
isn’t tinned, lots going on, and some sport again!
<i>Salama</i> for old Sir Geoffrey!”</p>

<p>He caught her round the waist, to the amazement
of Abdallah, who was bringing in the tea, and
waltzed her round the room, steering through the
scattered chairs and tables and even into the next
room with a dexterity that made her laugh until
she could not keep pace with him, and dropped on
to the sofa leaving Ally to finish with a grand <i>pas
seul</i> that landed him with a thud against the butler’s
portly person. Chum sat on the sofa, wiping her
eyes rather hysterically, while Ally and Abdallah
sorted themselves; and then they drank their tea
with a special allowance of sugar in it for the honour
of the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“When we get to Malta,” said Chum seriously,
“we will have cream too, as well as milk—can you
get cream in Malta, Ally?—and it shall be real tea,
up from India, not this nasty stuff from Natal.”
In the background of her mind she was always conscious
of a sense of reluctance, a desire that did
not accord with her earnest assertions of delight in
leaving Key Island. Some deep root in her very
nature seemed dragging her back whenever she
spoke of her departure, and the more she felt it the
more she repeated the idea as if to get used to it.
It was a thing she had to fight, and she faced it
desperately in this its very beginning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>It haunted her through the dance that night, and
the whirl of flying feet round the long mess-room.
It was too hot for dancing, but Mrs. Lewin did not
seem to feel the heat; she was indefatigable, and
waltzed through the programme, looking as cool and
dry at the end of the evening as at the beginning
which is a great feat for a Maitso dance. Leoline
wondered if this were the last time she should sit
out on the steps of the Mess, or keep time to the
Gunners’ band,—and thrust the thought away. It
was an ever-recurring ghost, that “last time,” and
stung most keenly, strange to say, through an introduction
to the guests of the evening, Captain and
Mrs. Ritchie Stern. Blanche Stern had very large
and searching eyes of a blue that mocked the sea—wholesome
eyes, that seemed never to have reflected
the image of any man save her husband, and indeed
the only thing that Mrs. Gilderoy could find to say
of her was that she posed as being in love with
Ritchie Stern to fatiguing extent. In an assembly
of auctioned men and assorted wives, she was
perhaps rather unlikely; but as their eyes met, Mrs.
Lewin put her hand to the diamond pendant at her
throat with a little start, and a choking feeling that
Mrs. Stern was divining her secret mind. They had
been introduced in a pause between the dances, and
were leaning over the wooden railing of the stoep
side by side, while their respective partners fought
for ices on their behalf. No African stoep should
have a railing of course, but Key Island has improved
upon its model in its own opinion, and has
gone further and twined the woodwork with stephanotis
and gardenia. The strong hothouse scents
were in Mrs. Ritchie’s nostrils as she leaned out
into the night, looking down on the lights of Port
Victoria.</p>

<p>“Captain Stern was here for a fortnight once,”
she said idly; “I often thought we should like it as
a station—it is such an idyllic place. How lovely
these flowers are!”</p>

<p>“It is horrible!” said Mrs. Lewin, with sudden
energy. “It is like a trap—you cannot get out,
and there is nothing to do. You would hate it!”
She was unconscious that she repeated every one
else’s <i>Miserere</i> for the first time.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should mind, if my husband
were here too,” said Blanche frankly. She turned
her eyes on Mrs. Lewin as if she saw something
that interested her in the restless beautiful figure.
“The worst of marrying a Navy man is that one
is not sufficiently considered in his appointments!
They <i>will</i> send Ritchie to dubious corners of the
earth, just when the children have arranged to
have the measles, and I can’t be in two places at
once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin looked across the stoep to the open
doorway where Captain Stern presented a good flat
back to her view as he talked to Major Churton.
She looked with unconscious wistfulness at his
shaven fair head and tanned neck, and wondered if
under the circumstances she would have felt her
heart torn in two because the seas divided them?
And then she remembered her ghost of reluctance
to leave this place that she said she hated, and Mrs.
Stern’s next words were full of horror to her.</p>

<p>“It is so short-sighted of women to stake their
little all on a man who is not safe to be no farther
off than the next room! I know I shall loathe this
harbour when I see the <i>Greville</i> slipping out of it
and over the horizon with a peace-maker for East
Africa—you know that that is what she is here for,
of course, or is it still an official and consequently
an open secret?”</p>

<p>“We have heard something of it. Does Captain
Stern expect to be here long?”</p>

<p>“He will leave the instant your Administrator
produces the man he has come to fetch. I don’t
really know who I dislike the most just now—the
Capetown people, who hurried him away on this
business, or the Port Cecil people, who are making
the trouble, or the man he is taking to the scene of
action.”</p>

<p>“Will he stop there?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so, for goodness knows how long!
Until the affair is settled one way or another, I
expect. Ritchie hopes he will get a chance to shell
the town, of course—you can imagine my feelings!
I do hope you are sending a nice, timid man from
Key’land, who prefers diplomacy to shells!”</p>

<p>“I can’t say who it will be, but it is almost
certain to be Mr. Halton, and he is a thorough
diplomatist. The whole thing is to be rather
hushed up, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and as peacefully arranged as possible, I
believe. That is my great comfort!” Mrs. Stern
laughed a little whimsically at herself. “The two
things the Government is aiming at are speed and
secrecy—not that there is much secrecy about it
amongst us, of course. But they seem bent on
prompt action for once, and I believe they want to
get it all settled quietly before the public at home
recognise that anything <i>more</i> is taking place in
Africa! That is why they are forwarding a man
from Key’land instead of from home or direct from
the Government out here. It is like going up the
back stairs to avoid comment! Well, it is about
time that Africa dropped into the background, isn’t
it? We were at Beira when Ritchie got his orders,
and as the mail was there I came on first. They
seem to have cabled in all directions from Capetown—to
us, and to your Administrator, and to the regiment
at Durban.”</p>

<p>“That is my husband’s regiment,” remarked
Chum, as she took the ice from her triumphant
partner at last. “I suppose it was quicker to transport
them by sea than across land.”</p>

<p>Later on it chanced that she danced with Ritchie
Stern, and caught herself analysing him with feverish
intensity as a man loved by, and in love with,
his own wife. Captain Stern was not a comforting
study, because there were no excuses in him for
one’s own failings. He was so simply a gentleman
as to make more questionable characters seem shady
by contrast, when without it they had been merely
complex. It was like plunging one’s hand into cold,
still water of an infinite depth, to try and plumb his
character, and his habit of speaking from the bottom
of his lungs rather than the top of his throat intensified
the impression. It was a matter of training,
but it seemed an outcome of his personality. He
struck Leoline Lewin as very kind, which depressed
her still more—she did not know why—and he
stood out in her mind as the one man she had
danced with who had not looked or spoken her a
compliment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“I like the Sterns very much, Ally,” she said as
they rode home in the faint coolness of the hour
before dawn—a mere promise of coolness, that was
never fulfilled by the day. “But they give me the
feeling of having been to church—do Navy people
ever strike you like that?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ally, who had other impressions of
ward-rooms, “very much the other way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean that,” said Chum vaguely.
“Only I feel that I have been listening to a sermon
in the open air—and I have grown so unused to the
open air that I am afraid of catching a moral cold.
Ally, how dreadfully confined we grow in garrisons!
Mrs. Stern brings the sea winds to you in
her eyes.”</p>

<p>“You are not growing poetical, are you, Chum?”
said Ally suspiciously. “I thought Stern a very
decent chap—can’t imagine him preaching.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t!” said Chum, dropping to the old
level of his thought, and abandoning her own.
“But I preached myself the sermon on him as the
text, and it was, ‘Woe unto them who can see their
own wives, for they shall not see any one else’s!’
What lovely emeralds Mrs. Stern was wearing, by
the way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I wish I could give you some more stones.
I’ll try, if we get to Malta.”</p>

<p>“I would rather have nice clothes than jewels,”
said Chum. “A dowdy woman with diamonds is
worse dressed than a <i>chic</i> one with paste, all the
world over. And we can’t run to both—even at
Malta.”</p>

<p>“Did you like Mrs. Stern?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” said Chum, her eyes darkening to the
shadows on purple velvet. “And I hope I shall
not meet her again.”</p>

<p>She said the last words savagely, under her breath.
They were her echo to Mrs. Stern’s, that still hurt
her, and made her afraid of the eyes that divined
her secret mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“It is so short-sighted of women to stake their
little all on a man who is not safe to be no farther
off than the next room!”</p>

<p>She began to feel that she could hardly wait for
Ally’s appointment to be a certainty; if the Administrator
did not inform him of his good fortune
soon, the strain on their nerves would make them
both ill-tempered, and that was a vulgarity not to
be contemplated. Alaric and she had always been
as courteous to each other as two acquaintances; it
was one of her theories of married life, and not yet
overthrown by experience. The indefiniteness of
his own escape affected Ally too, so that they were
both unusually restless, and it was a relief next
morning when breakfast was over and he could go
up to Government House.</p>

<p>“Don’t be late for luncheon, Ally!” Chum said,
following him on to the stoep, where he paused to
light his cigarette, a white figure against the green
of the garden. “It will be so awful waiting!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shan’t have any news,” said Alaric in
gloomy anticipation.</p>

<p>“He must speak of it to-day!”</p>

<p>“It would be just like him not to. He will be so
immersed in the East African business, he will forget
all about our little affairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>A momentary doubt dawned in Mrs. Lewin’s
eyes. She thought of the Gilderoys’ picnic, and
that large heavy hand on her own. Was she
indeed a slight incident in his mind, to be brushed
aside by larger interests? She had never set eyes
on Gregory since that moment, and the new sweet
fear of him that had overwhelmed her was in
abeyance for the present. Perhaps Ally was right,
and they were only details in this man’s career,
a mere speck on his ambition. She tried for
nothing but honest relief as she turned back to the
house.</p>

<p>“Well come and tell me anyway,” she said over
her shoulder. “I <i>must</i> know!”</p>

<p>“All right,” he replied, more soberly than usual.
“I will come back the second he will let me—I
really will! It’s no joking matter to either of us.”</p>

<p>The morning was growing too hot to be out of
doors as he walked off through the rose-bushes, and
out of the gate into the grounds of Government
House. Mrs. Lewin stood in the doorway until the
white helmet flitted out of sight among the thickening
trees, and then went in to write letters. The
writing-table stood close to one of the seven windows,
and she slid up the shutter and fastened the
pin so that the draught should fan her comfortably,
before she began her correspondence. Outside a
wild hot wind was rushing over the hillside, and the
smell of innumerable flowers dripped in on its
breath. She wrote slowly, and the sentences would
not come. All her brain seemed to have followed
Ally, and to be waiting with him for the Administrator
to speak.</p>

<p>At the hour of the Miroro she went into her
room and lay down under the mosquito curtains
with a fan in her hand. Usually she fanned herself
to sleep, but to-day sleep would not come any
more than the flow of words. For half-an-hour
she lay in the hot, still room, counting the silver
things on the dressing-table, and the photographs
on the wall, and noticing without her will that the
black girl who attended to her room, had not hung
her gowns aright. Natives were so tiresome; it
would be almost better to experiment with an
Arab.</p>

<p>Would the time never go? Was Ally never
coming?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>She rose before lunch could possibly be ready,
and dressed herself. Then she wandered into the
central room that served for drawing-room and
lounge, and from which the others all opened out.
She found Ally’s cigarettes on a table and smoked
one, turning over the pages of last month’s magazines,
which had just come in by the mail. The
smudgy illustrations annoyed her, and she flung
them by and rose restlessly, wandering about the
hot, sweet rooms, and listening for his step through
the glare outside.</p>

<p>Still he did not come. It was past the luncheon
hour now, and Abdallah had put the finishing
touches to the table and stood by in grave reproach,
his snowy turban already on, and his hands
folded over his tunic. Abdallah was always severely
white at luncheon, his costume consisting merely of
a tunic and turban; but by dinner-time he had added
a coloured bandana and an embroidered jacket.
His motionless presence added the last irritation to
her overwrought mood, and she sent him away until
Captain Lewin should appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>The hours dragged away, until the morning had
slipped into afternoon. Still he did not come.
With a feeling that she wanted to shriek hysterically,
Leoline paced steadily up and down the broad
floors of the bungalow, from one shaded room into
another, and so back to the corner where the table
was still spread. She could not eat, and she felt
that Ally might come at any moment. Something
was keeping him—not his own pleasure this time;
his being transferred from Key Island was a weighty
matter even to him, and she knew he would return
to her for advice and support as soon as he could.
He could see his own interest sufficiently in this to
resist a passing temptation, but there was none to
keep him at Government House. The horrible part
was that it might be nothing but trivial duties that
detained him after all, and they might have to go
through this suspense again. The heat seemed to
get no less as the day wore towards four o’clock,
and her limbs began to feel lifeless and heavy, as if
paralysed. When at last the door opened and he
walked quietly in, she did not rise to meet him or
spring up for a minute. She sat there watching him
come straight towards her with a curious speculative
feeling that there was a grave importance in his
manner that seemed a little ridiculous. She criticised
him as if he were somebody not belonging to
her.</p>

<p>“Well!” she said rising at last, in a slow mechanical
fashion. She looked at him all across the room.
Yes, certainly he was so grave as to be unlike himself—not
depressed, but self-sufficient, almost pompous.
It was so foreign to any mood in which she
had seen Alaric before that she could only stare at
him.</p>

<p>He sat down heavily in a basket chair that
creaked beneath his weight, and so added to her absurd
impression that he was assuming the air of an
elderly and important personage. He did not speak
either at once, and when he did he seemed to be
weighing his words, as if he said a solemn thing.</p>

<p>“I have got it!”</p>

<p>“The appointment?” she said with a long breath,
trying to shake off her own leadenness and the
effect of his strange manner. “Oh, Ally, what
good news! I have been so frightened—when you
did not come, you know,—I thought we might still
have to wait.”</p>

<p>“He spoke of it almost at once. We have talked
of little else. He was giving me minute instructions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>A blank feeling of non-comprehension seemed to
take possession of her. He was still unlike himself,
or else Gregory’s earnestness had impressed him at
last. Perhaps the force of the stronger man had
been let loose on the weaker for once, for the sake
of urging him to a more serious sense of his position.
She knew that Gregory had been impatient
of his indifference in his present post; perhaps he
had told him plainly that he must be more conscientious
with Sir Geoffrey Vaughan.</p>

<p>“Instructions!” she repeated slowly. “For
Malta?”</p>

<p>“No—not that. I am going to East Africa.”</p>

<p>She did not cry out, but she fell back a step as if
some unknown hand had struck her a heavy blow.
Her eyes were absolutely frightened, and she spoke
in a low voice of intense terror.</p>

<p>“But Ally—you can’t! You daren’t accept it—you
can’t do it!”</p>

<p>He fired at the last words as if he half expected
them. “Why not?” he said irritably. “Why can’t
I do it? I must accept it—you must see that! I
have accepted it already. It is arranged.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do it!” she repeated bluntly. “It is
a heavy responsibility to give to any man—any
experienced man even. Why isn’t Mr. Halton
going?”</p>

<p>“He can’t be spared; there is an awful row going
on already over the crops.”</p>

<p>“The hemp!” she said breathlessly, her memory
going back to those words of Gregory’s—“They
have given me <i>carte blanche</i> to do as I think best”—“They
are not burning the crops?”</p>

<p>“Yes they are. The order went out yesterday.
There is a compensation of course, but the Chinese
are furious, and that gives them away, for they must
have been making their fortunes out of the hashish.
Halton must stay and see Gregory through it—he
has no one to send but me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>In a streak of terror through her quickened brain
it seemed as if she saw all the disaster of the choice.
She had never finally acknowledged to herself that
Ally depended on her for the least success in his
life, but in the stress of the moment she knew that
with her to guide and counsel and manage he might
come through this ordeal—not creditably, but without
failure. Without her it was like sending a child
to play with a train of gunpowder. Some horrible
intuition seemed to tell her his incapacity, and excuse
the belief in herself. Ally in a position that
needed absolute diplomacy! Ally managing a delicate
enquiry that might lead to a serious issue!
She realised only in her dismay that she could not
go with him to East Africa to save him from failure—the
loss of her own escape from secret peril did
not really trouble her mind at the time. The fear
for him drove her to repeating blankly, “You can’t
do it—you mustn’t!”</p>

<p>“Good God, Chum!” he exclaimed in a sudden
squall of irritation, “you are ridiculous! What do
you mean? You are always worrying me over
getting on, and having a career, and now that I
have got an opening, you seem to want me to back
out! Don’t you see that I can’t? Gregory isn’t
the man to give me a second chance. He is offering
me a tremendous lift in putting me in such a
position.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>Only one sentence in his angry speech found
room for itself in her mind, for she saw that it was
true. He could not back out. Evelyn Gregory
had him fast in his iron grip, and if he chose to send
him to his ruin he was helpless. She laid her hand
on the back of a chair and held it cruelly tight as
if to help herself to think. Why had he done this?
Why? She kept asking herself the question again
and again, and found no answer. It was so plausible
on the face of it, this threatened rising over the
hemp-crops, and Halton’s presence as an immediate
necessity, that she felt that it was not true. To the
outside world the appointment of an emissary sent
to Port Cecil to “enquire” might come within
Alaric’s sphere, particularly under the stress of circumstances
in Key Island, but not to her. She had
a giant fear of Gregory born of her greater knowledge
of him that no one in the Island could share.
As she stood there looking with unseeing eyes at
Alaric’s handsome, annoyed face, she saw only the
shadowy strength of the man whom she had learned
to know—unscrupulous, tyrannical, successful because
he allowed nothing to stand in his way. Now
that she and hers were to be swept aside after his
method, she began to realise for the first time the
atmosphere of terror that had seemed to hang round
him in the minds of those who first spoke of him to
her. Hitherto she had been but a spectator, and
he had interested her as a danger of which one only
reads. To find oneself threatened by the same
thing in reality makes the difference.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Alaric at last, with the half-offended
air of a spoilt child, “I’m sorry you are not
better pleased, Chum! I thought you would be as
proud as I felt when he told me. Of course I’m
sorry to leave you behind, old girl, but perhaps we
shall get something good out of this later.” He
spoke half apologetically, but the old easy optimism
was coming back to him. Fortune had always given
Alaric what he wanted; he took her gifts for
granted.</p>

<p>“Who will have Malta? Brissy?” said his wife
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, he’s off next mail—not by this. Of course
he’ll have to be officially appointed; but Gregory
has answered Sir Geoffrey’s letter privately, as he
was asked. I shall have to go to-morrow, or next
day at latest, Chum. I’m sorry!” he added simply,
as a tribute to parting with her.</p>

<p>But she felt suddenly that he was glad to go—glad
even of this chance of action. He did not
mind leaving her behind if only he were free of the
monotony of Key Island, which also held more uncomfortable
memories for him than his wife guessed.
Things were getting complicated round Ally, and
what had been a pleasant indulgence and flattering
to his vanity, was growing to be a tie exacted from
him by a jealous woman. He could not have told,
if he had honestly tried to do so, how he had drifted
so far with Diana Churton; such men as Alaric
Lewin are as incapable of accounting for the crisis
of their lives as they are of managing them. He
trusted to fortune again. Events had generally
shaped themselves comfortably for him; and, as in
the present case, when there was a tight corner the
natural march of circumstances had forced him out
of it without any responsibility on his part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Circumstances were marching him out now, and
he was really glad. Captain Stern and the <i>Greville</i>
would carry him safely away from Key Island to-morrow,
and Diana’s last note which he had found
at the club would go unanswered through no fault
of his. He couldn’t go to Maitso to-night, it was
out of the question. For the look of the thing he
must spend what might be his last evening with
Chum—and of course he wanted to, he added mentally
to the back of her head, as she bent over his
portmanteau. His Malagasan man was busy over
the shirt case, and he himself ramming the surplus
of his property into the kit-bag, but Chum had become
her old self again, and risen to the occasion of
his packing, once the stupefaction of his news had
passed off. He was sure it was only the surprise
which had made her unlike herself; she was
getting on more with the portmanteau, in spite of
the heat, than either Longa or himself with their
share.</p>

<p>“Ally,” said Mrs. Lewin quietly, as she tucked a
pair of socks into an empty corner, “will you go
over to the Churtons to-night to say good-bye?”</p>

<p>“N—no!” He stammered a little, in the discomfort
of his own knowledge. “It’s my last evening
most likely, Chum!—at least we may go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. (Mind the gun-case, Longa!)
I didn’t mean you to be out all the time. But I
think you might ride over and just say good-bye—you
would be back in an hour. They will be so
awfully hurt if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ally uneasily. A sensible and considerate
wife is a very useful article so long as her
husband wishes to make use of these two qualities;
when he does not, he would prefer her to be more
unreasonable.</p>

<p>Chum’s suggestion was awkward, because he was
afraid to refuse to go to Maitso lest she should be
surprised.... Hang it! the whole thing had
become a nuisance. How glad he was he should
be out of it to-morrow! Then a brilliant idea
struck him. He would go down to the club and be
detained. He could write Di a note, too, from
there, and ask her to come down and see him off if
possible. He did not know when they would leave,
so it was most probable that she would miss him—he
did not mind that either. Anyhow, there would
be plenty of fellows at the club to make an excuse
for getting no further. He might see Churton too.
He liked Churton—when he didn’t feel a grovelling
cad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“All right, perhaps I’d better. I can go after
dinner, but I shan’t be long,” he said. Mrs. Lewin
did not answer or look at him. She was very busy
over the portmanteau.</p>

<p>It was rather a silent dinner, but he noticed with
real pain and affection how soft and fair Leoline
looked in her long white dinner-gown, and wondered
when they would have one of their merry <i>tête-à-tête</i>
meals again. He was devoted to his wife—in
theory at any rate. Perhaps Chum could not have
pleaded much more, save that she tried to practise
what she preached. If men were not such complex
animals the Day of Judgment would be a simpler
ceremony, but as things are they will have many
pleas to enter of former good conduct and extenuating
circumstances. Ally rode away with his heart
full of his wife, because she had entered there
through his eyes, and with no thought of infidelity
to her. At the club he sat down and wrote a note,
which was the more emphatic because he did not
mean it, and a little more reckless in expression
than usual because he was going away in safety.</p>

<p>He could not find his own sais, who should have
followed him into town to look after his pony, and
risked sending a loafer whom he knew by sight, to
Maitso. The man grinned and put the letter in his
breast before he hitched up his trousers to show his
zeal, the action meaning that Captain Lewin was to
understand he would run all the way.</p>

<p>Ally laughed good-naturedly. “Mind it’s important.
Give it to Mrs. Churton herself,” he said.
“I’ll pay you when you come back without it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Baas! I give it dere!” said the nigger,
and he started off at a jog-trot along the twinkling
street towards the dusk of Maitso Hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>Ally turned back into the club, still laughing.</p>

<p>“It is a little unfortunate all round,” said the
Commissioner. “Or perhaps inconvenient is the
better word.”</p>

<p>“As far as it affects you, you are better off than if
you were going to Port Cecil. This may not be
anything—we may cool down and tide over, and
you will catch this mail. She does not leave until
Thursday.”</p>

<p>The Administrator was sitting at his own writing-table,
with his back to Halton, who had also been
at work, as the scattered papers testified. The
room was one of many in Government House that
had no especial use, and had been given up to the
work of the enquiry. The third chair and littered
writing-table was at the moment unoccupied, and
belonged to Captain Lewin. Over Halton’s head
ranged a portly array of shelves on which the old
papers and accounts of the British African Island
Co., Ltd., were dustily stored, and attracted the
mosquitoes, as well as a water-tank, for though he
cannot breed in them the mosquito loves a book-shelf
that is not often disturbed, and creeps along
the volumes’ edges and hides behind their bulk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Hardly!” said the Commissioner, with a slight
shrug. “She has nearly finished discharging her
cargo already, and will not take two days to coal.”
He reached up over his head, and took down one
of the dusty volumes a little curiously, as if he had
not observed it before. There were some books of
reference among the old ledgers, and this, to judge
from its appearance, was one, rather than an account
book.</p>

<p>“You will get the next boat, then,” said Gregory,
off-handedly. His back being towards his coadjutator
as he thus dismissed the subject of his convenience,
he did not see Halton’s eyes as he slowly
raised them from the old book and looked at him.
It seemed he had found the passage he wanted, for
he kept his finger on a yellowed leaf while he
spoke.</p>

<p>“I see of course the expediency of remaining
here at the moment, as you have decided on the
necessity of such a stringent measure as burning
the hemp-crop.” His voice was formal, and so
perfectly controlled that it contained neither anger
nor disapprobation nor argument. The Administrator’s
busy pen stopped. He lifted his head
slightly as though listening, and came within the
radius of the shaded electric light. But the shorn
reddish hair betrayed nothing unless it were the fact
that he was growing very grey towards the temples.
His overhanging brow and secretive mouth were
not visible to the Commissioner, whose level voice
ran on quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“Before closing this matter, however, I should
like for principle’s sake to enter a protest, though it
is merely a matter of form. I do not consider
Captain Lewin a fit man to send to East Africa on
this business. I believe him to be absolutely incapable
of the anxious work before him, and if he
does not make a hash of the whole business it will
be a miracle. The power of course lies in your
hands; the decision is with you. I am not here to
advise you in this, but, unofficially, I should be doing
an unfriendly thing if I did not warn you of
my opinion as to his incompetence.”</p>

<p>For a minute there was silence, while the last
words hung in the air like a menace. They meant
more than the private counsel of one man to another—they
might also be translated as warning
Gregory that his ally’s opinion of Lewin’s incapacity
would find voice in high places. It was perhaps a
gauge thrown down, and if so it was taken up very
quietly in the next few words, that the Administrator
uttered as naturally as if it were the inevitable reply
to Halton’s argument.</p>

<p>“I am writing to Melton Hanney to do his best
to give Captain Lewin every assistance in his power.
He knows Port Cecil well. Had the Government
been advised by me they would have put the matter
in his hands, instead of which they have insisted on
my sending some one from here. There is only
my A.D.C. to send.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Halton’s hand was still on the noted
passage. His eyes followed the slight shrug of
Gregory’s mighty shoulders, while he felt with savage
impotence that one might turn a tiger from its
prey, sooner than this man from his purpose.
Halton would not have dared to do the thing that
he saw as plainly as its perpetrator; and because he
knew he dared not, he hated the man who could
and would with a hate born of self-knowledge.</p>

<p>“Melton Hanney is an old friend of yours, is he?
You know him as a good man?” he said.</p>

<p>“I have known him for about sixteen years,” said
Gregory grimly. “And watched successive Governments
pass him over for good work done.”
This was the man of whom Leoline had spoken to
Blanche Stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“I have no doubt he is the right person to consult
on such a situation. Knowledge on the spot is
beyond value,” said Halton, rising from his chair,
and laying the book still open on his table. “I am
going down to see White, Gregory. As yet I am
not a marked man; but if you take my advice you
will not ride alone through Port Victoria at present.
The niggers are fit to dance the <i>Cannab Dance</i> for
you!”</p>

<p>“The curs—I wish they had spirit enough! No,
there might be the makings of a fight at China
Town, but our mixed breeds will hardly show their
teeth here. If you are going to see White, Halton,
I wish you would ask him to come up early to-morrow,
unless he would prefer to meet me at the
office at eleven. I have business to discuss with
him.”</p>

<p>“I shall recommend his coming here,” said
Halton, with a slightly strained smile. “In spite
of your contempt for them I should not be surprised
to find a deputation of these ‘mixed breeds’
waiting on you—with razors. If I were in your
position, I tell you frankly I should ask the O.C.T.
for a picket.”</p>

<p>“There’s a shambok on the wall there,” said
Gregory with quiet significance. “It would answer
the same purpose—and is quite handy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>He did not turn his head as Halton’s retreating
steps died away from the room, but he noticed with
more interest the sound of a little silver clock striking
eight. He often worked up to ten o’clock at
night, and had come back to write his letters direct
from the dinner-table. The one to Melton Hanney
was too long for an official document, and more
private than he had indicated to Halton. He intended
giving it to Alaric Lewin to deliver direct,
and had cabled in cypher to Hanney to inform him
of his advent. As he directed and sealed the
envelope it struck him that the room was hot, and
he rose and opened the long window-doors on to
the stoep, passing Halton’s table as he did so. The
book lay open where the Commissioner had left it,
and with a passing wonder as to what he had been
reading, Gregory’s eyes fell upon it and discovered
that it was an old Bible, probably kept there for
purposes of oath-making.</p>

<p>The Administrator took the book up deliberately
in his strong hands, and looked to see what had
engrossed Alfred Halton so deeply. He remembered
how the flicker of the thin pages carefully
turned, behind him, had worried his ear while he
tried to concentrate all his thought and care upon
the letter to Hanney, for it had been a dangerous
letter to write, and every word had been weighed.
Even then he had found it necessary to seal it, and
would have to apologise to Lewin when asking him
to deliver it. Halton had been looking for something,
or he would not have turned those pages with
such intent. Evelyn Gregory held up the faded
print to the light.</p>

<p>It was the story of Uriah.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass in the morning that David
wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of
Uriah.</p>

<p>“And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah
in the forefront of the battle, and retire ye from him,
that he may be smitten, and die.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass, when Joab observed the
city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place whence he
knew that valiant men were.</p>

<p>“And the men of the city went out, and fought
with Joab; and there fell some of the people of
the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died
also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Certain passages in his own letter rose in
Gregory’s mind as distinctly and slowly as the note
of the little silver clock when it had chimed out the
hour. “I am forced to send a fool, because Government
have cabled ... but I can only rely
on you to do your best to save his mistakes, and
get us out of the mess if he hashes it.... Do
you remember Barotse, and the night you said you
owed me more than a life? Well, if you want to
pay, back me up now.... Lewin is one of
those favoured animals with Friends. I am always
being urged to make a show for him. Don’t take
his place, but follow him up and cover his tracks.
If the fool has anything in him it must show up
now. Give him a free hand—it is the consequences
I want you to manage. I know I am asking a hard
thing of you, all the work and no pay; but then
I could trust no one else, if that’s <i>Salama</i> to
you.... <i>Above all, keep Lewin in the front of
things.</i>”</p>

<p>He put down the Bible with a steady hand, and
his iron jaws closed slowly, hardening his face into
its ugliest lines. Yet for a moment he stood by
the table thinking, and facing his own letter unflinchingly,
as he saw it in his mind, side by side
with one written dusty centuries ago by another
strong man to his captain.</p>

<p>“Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the battle——”</p>

<p>“Above all, keep Lewin in the front of things.”</p>

<p>He was roused by the door being opened, because
no attention had rewarded the servant’s
patient tapping, but he looked at his master
apologetically.</p>

<p>“A lady wishes to see you, sir!” he breathed
rather than spoke, as if his own extraordinary
message confused him.</p>

<p>“A lady!” Gregory glanced involuntarily at the
little silver clock; it pointed to half-past eight.</p>

<p>“It is Mrs. Lewin, sir, she said she must see you
for a minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Ask her to come in here,” said Gregory, turning
his back suddenly upon the man. He looked
at the open window half as if he would have closed
it, and at the shaded light half as if he would have
extinguished it, for his face was out of control.
Even when he turned round to meet his visitor, he
offered her his hand in silence, and she was vaguely
surprised that he seemed to have suddenly gone
bloodless. The big veins swelled on his temples
though, and his eyes looked sunken and cavernous.
She heard the door shut slowly, and fancied that
the servant who had admitted her shared her
curiosity and would fain have lingered. All personal
feeling and sense of embarrassment had been
swept from her mind by the events which had overwhelmed
her in the last few hours, and she did not
remember that she had not really met the man
standing before her since his hand had rested on
hers at the picnic. She was not an impulsive
woman, and yet it had been impulse that had made
her send Ally to Maitso, impulse that had made her
wait feverishly for the moment of his departure,
that had hurried her feet along the familiar garden
and through the grounds of Government House the
instant his pony’s hoofs died away down the hill.
She was devoured by a desire to know why Gregory
had done her this ill turn, and was sending her husband
to certain failure, for he knew Alaric’s incapacity
as well as she. It was impulse now that
drove her forward a step towards him, and made her
voice low and hurried as she spoke straight to him
without any more formal greeting.</p>

<p>“Why have you done this? Are you mad?
What has made you send him to Port Cecil instead
of to Sir Geoffrey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>He was looking at her with his long, hard stare,
taking in every line of her white figure in its
feminine softness and beauty. Her hair was waved
back from her forehead more than usual, as if she
had pushed it there in her impatient thought, and
beneath her delicate drawn brows her velvet eyes
were alight as if with pain. He felt stupid with
passion, and remembered with a curious thrill the
occasion on which he had seen her in her nightdress,
her hair thrown back from her forehead with
much the same effect, and the same strained look
in her eyes—it seemed that her husband was always
the cause of her looking so.</p>

<p>She had taken a step forward. He took one
also, and they stood close together, with nothing
to hinder their direct gaze into each other’s faces.
His whispering voice was horribly audible, and yet
suppressed as he answered her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lewin, you have asked me to do my best
for your husband, and give him a chance if Government
referred to me to recommend him. I am
giving him a chance. What reason have you to
complain?”</p>

<p>She threw out her hands with a little movement
of desperation, almost as if she would have seized
his arm and shaken him. “Oh, don’t lie, now!”
she exclaimed. “Tell me the truth—the truth!
You know he may ruin himself if he goes without
me. Why did you not send us to this other appointment
that was put in your hands? If you had
mentioned his name, instead of Captain Nugent’s, to
Sir Geoffrey Vaughan, we should have been moved
from here together. Why did you not do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>He did not ask her how she had known of his
private letter from the old general. He stood and
looked at her still, and moistened his lips as if he
could hardly speak. She saw his tongue touch
them like a wicked snake before the words would
come. He bent a little more towards her, and his
lidless eyes probed hers mercilessly.</p>

<p>“Because I could not part from you!” he said
distinctly, and yet he seemed to speak without a
real note in his voice.</p>

<p>She fell back in exactly the same mechanical
way that she had gone forward, and her eyes
blinked before his as if before too strong a light.
Very slowly she lifted her pretty hands and laid
them over her breast as if with an unconscious
effort to quiet the throbbing of the pulses there.
He had not moved; but her voice was almost
as toneless as his, when she spoke, from utter
terror.</p>

<p>“Do you realise what you are doing? That it is
not only his own career that Ally may risk, but—but
the whole situation in East Africa. If he
bungles it you will be held responsible!”</p>

<p>He bent his head so slightly that it seemed he
hardly moved.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it.”</p>

<p>“And you——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Their eyes still met. She drew a sharp breath as
if she stood suddenly in too strong an air. It
seemed to her as if the personality of the man
buffeted her, and she could not stand against it.
She was afraid of any one who could gamble with
Government like this, and stake empires for his
own hazard. It was sweeping her off her feet, and
leaving her helpless in a vortex of feeling she was
not able to control. Her own nature she thought
she could fight and conquer, but she saw with sudden
panic that the one before her was beyond her
yes or no—she might influence, but she could not
dominate it as she had her husband’s. If he had
chosen to take her savagely in his arms, she could
have protested, but she could not have averted the
embrace by the power of her will. Hitherto Leoline
Lewin had drawn an invisible line of demarcation
between herself and mankind, and had known
that none would dare to overstep it. But this man
would not be conscious of the line. Nothing but
his own restraint could save her from the peril of
touch at least.</p>

<p>The windows still stood wide open to the windless
night. She was waiting for she knew not what,
when Gregory suddenly turned his head, listened,
and faced round from her towards the apertures.
The stars struggled against the electric light to
make the stoep a grey vagueness, and it stretched,
empty and silent, beyond the house itself. For a
minute there was nothing but the whirring of the
crickets, and the shrill wearisome cry of a tree frog
that pierced the hearing. Then through all the
natural clamour of tropical darkness came the rustle
of human presence, the tread of feet, and the sound
of many voices rising from the gardens. Something
white rushed on to the stoep, and at the same moment
Gregory had made a stride for the light and
turned it off. His own figure and Mrs. Lewin’s
must have been sharply visible a second before from
the garden outside, as they stood in the strong light
of the room, objects for missiles or bullets; but as
he walked forward to the intruder he alone was in
view.</p>

<p>“What is it, Ahmed?” he said.</p>

<p>The man was one of his own servants, an Arab,
and with more than an Arab’s craven fear of danger
in his quivering body at the present moment. He
stood shaking and sweating, his words broken with
fright as he tried to speak.</p>

<p>“They have passed the gate! They are coming
up here! Quick, Effendi!—get to the stables and
ride for the barracks! The soldiers will fight
for us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin, standing in the dusk of the room
behind him, saw Gregory take the man by his linen
tunic, swing him over like an inconsiderable bundle,
and roll him along the stoep out of his way. Then
he stepped quickly to the wall and took something
in his hand. She caught the long quiver of a
shambok as he spoke to her briefly over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“There is going to be a noise, I expect, but it
won’t be much. It is only a lot of niggers come
up to call me out and protest about the crops. Can
you load a revolver?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Well, do so, and shoot as many blacks as you
like. The more the better. There is a revolver in
the second drawer of that table, and cartridges.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you have it?”</p>

<p>“No; this will do for me. I should like to flay
half-a-dozen, and teach them how the Kaffirs die
under this thing!” The shambok quivered ominously,
and the roused blood in his veins was evidently
finding an outlet in the hope of savage
assault. She shuddered a little as his large gaunt
figure vanished through the window on to the
stoep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>The “deputation” that Halton had foretold was a
motley crowd, and by sheer force of numbers rather
than belligerence, had pushed the sentry aside and
swarmed up to the house in an unorganised attack.
Amongst the half-drunken niggers who were dancing
amicably amongst themselves instead of forming
up with the semblance of an opposing force, the
little blue figures of the Chinese were visible, and
all the anger of the assembly seemed to be concentrated
in them. As Gregory stalked on to the stoep
the clamour rose, the half-hysterical ribaldry of the
blacks clearing to threats and words, and the Chinamen
jabbering like monkeys. Through it all the
cry of the Malagasy “Ra!” (blood) cut the tumult
like a clear bass note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>The Administrator leaned over the rail, gripping
it with his lean hands, and looking down at the
upturned faces with his hard stare. The insolence
of his attitude seemed to half rouse, half tame the
crowd. They wavered, but the sing-song snarl
which Mrs. Lewin had heard in the hour of the
Miroro, went on like an accompaniment to the
crickets. Words were indistinguishable, but some
one on the outskirts of the throng flung a cocoanut
which hit the zinc roofing of the stoep, and, as if it
were a signal, half-a-dozen blue figures swarmed
over the railing and made a rush for Gregory.
Leoline had moved by instinct nearer the window,
with the loaded revolver in her hand. She remembered
that Halton had said that Gregory loved a
row, for she heard him laugh shortly, as if in enjoyment
of his own excitement, while he stepped back
and awaited them. No other missile was flung as
she expected it would be, but she wondered if the
crowd were armed with razors as the rioters had
been before. Then she saw a curious sight, for the
first of the Chinamen to approach too near was
caught by the swing of the supple shambok and
fell on his back with the breath knocked out of
him, and Gregory advanced on the others, literally
sweeping the stoep clear again by the force of his
swinging blows. The hide whickered viciously as
it cut the still air, and once a shriek answered its
awful “Whir-r-r-r-r-h!” telling how the blow had
caught its victim. The absolute and savage contempt
with which he whipped them off the stoep,
like curs, gave the woman watching him a revelation
of the abhorrence in which the Englishman
really holds the alien, and especially after many
years spent amongst coloured races. She had met
with something of it in her husband, and learned
more from Captain Gilderoy’s frank brutality in
speaking of them; but now she saw and realised.
Gregory kicked the last man into the garden and
came back to her laughing horribly. The curious
part to her was that they did not resist, and he did
not even wait to see the humming crowd melt
away into the darkness as it was fast doing.</p>

<p>“If there were any organisation among them
they might be worth killing,” he said, taking the
revolver from her. “As it is I would have made
an example of one of those Chinamen—shamboked
him so that he would brew no hashish!—if you had
not been there. But it’s not a pretty sight.”</p>

<p>“Are they gone?” she asked with stiff lips.
The march of events seemed to have stunned her.
She had a sick feeling that she could bear no more,
and that she had lived through crisis after crisis in
a few hours, which would in an ordinary way be
spread over as many years.</p>

<p>“They will be in a few minutes, but if you will
excuse me I will just go and give orders to see
that the grounds are quite clear before you walk
back.”</p>

<p>She was thankful that the sudden incursion of
natives seemed to have deferred any further scene
between them. He was alert and full of fire, but it
was not directly for her, though he took elaborate
care for her escort back to the bungalow, and
accompanied her as far as the garden gate himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Tell your own servants to keep a look out,” he
said. “But I expect Captain Lewin will hear that
there was a threatened row and come up in hot
haste to look after you.” He dismissed the Arabs
who had accompanied them, with a nod, and held
out his hand to her. “Good-night!” he said in a
gentler tone, that made her nerves shoot with fearful
anticipation. “You were very good and brave.
I hope you were not much frightened.”</p>

<p>“I do not think I realised it all at the moment—you
were so cool over it.”</p>

<p>“Because there really was no immediate danger.
That was not an organised attack—it was a foretaste
of what might happen. That is why I am
obliged to detain the Commissioner—to confirm
my action should a real riot break out.” He
looked at her straight, and she saw that he feared
no real danger, and that this was the assertion he
meant to fling in the face of the world as his excuse
for keeping Halton and sending her husband
away—she saw it, but it fell on stunned senses. No
one who had seen him to-night would believe that
he could fear an attack, however organised, or see
any necessity to detain the Commissioner. But
she had borne all she could bear at present. She
wished him good-night, and turned towards the
lights of her own house, like one walking in her
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Good-night!” he said again, and looked round
him, from the dusky garden to the gate which her
hand had closed between them, and along the dark
pathway to Government House. “When there
was a threatened riot before, and I roused you up,
I came by the road, for I was riding. But this is
the best path on foot. I have never been this way—before.”</p>

<p>Captain Lewin’s bearer was what Mr. Halton
would have described as an “average idiot” among
niggers, but he was anxious to earn his fee, and his
anxiety increased his intelligence to a disastrous
extent. As soon as he got out of his employer’s
range of vision, of course his shambling trot degenerated
into a saunter, and he loafed up Maitso
Hill, calling out salutations to the natives whom he
met coming down from work, for they employed
black labour at the garrison. Still he did not absolutely
stop, even to talk to the rickety trains of mule
carts, whose drivers began a high-pitched conversation
with him as soon as they came within sight.
No Key Island nigger waits to begin his gossip until
he is close to his friend; most of his conversation
is screamed in patois from one end of a street to another,
as his acquaintance comes round a corner,
and the mixture of bastard Arabic, and African-Dutch,
and what he thinks is English, bound together
by long, lovely Malagasy words, is, to say
the least of it, peculiar. By dint of keeping on,
however, even at a saunter, the bearer reached the
Churtons’ bungalow in some half-hour’s time after he
started from the club, and came soundlessly through
the screen of logwood, his bare feet lost in the dust,
and guided by the lights that twinkled from the
stoep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Before he reached the house itself he saw one of
its inmates approaching leisurely, and paused himself,
because it would have been waste of energy to
take the few extra steps and call up the mistress,
when here was the master of the house already at
hand. Major Churton was smoking, the red end of
his cigar looking like a strayed firefly among the
light logwood leaves as he advanced, his big person
very big indeed in its white linen and looming
through the dusk like a substantial ghost. He had
come out in the hope of getting more air than was
possible on the stoep, and being in canvas shoes his
advance was almost as soundless as the nigger’s.
Both men stared at each other through the darkness
as if to make sure of the other’s personality,—Major
Churton because he did not expect to see a ragged
loafer from the town about his house after dusk, and
Captain Lewin’s bearer because he saw the end of
his responsibility before him if this were really the
Bimbashi (Major).</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” said Churton
shortly.</p>

<p>“A letter, Baas!” The man drew it out of the
rags that covered his breast, and shifted from one
foot to the other in the dust, with an apologetic
smile on his vacant face. He held the letter to
Churton and nodded insistently.</p>

<p>“For me?” said the Major as he took it. It was
too dark to see the inscription, but he held the
cigar between his large white teeth and broke the
seal, moving into the faint light from the stoep to
decipher it.</p>

<p>“Yaas, Baas. Captain Lewin sent it—I give it
to you yourself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>The man had jumbled his orders, and in all good
faith believed that the letter was to go to the owners
of the bungalow direct—whether the Bimbashi
or the Missus had it, did not enter his head as of
importance, for he thought the point was that it
should not pass through the hands of the servants.
Having delivered his message he did not linger in
the hope of a reward at this end of his journey, for
Major Churton’s crisp manner was not encouraging;
he hurried off to catch his employer still at
the club and claim his fee, and with a brief
“Efenin’, Baas!” his noiseless figure shambled into
the darkness again, and departed down the hill.</p>

<p>But Major Churton did not answer the salutation.
He was standing close against the railing of the
stoep, but necessarily below it, as the bungalow
was lifted a foot or so above the ground on account
of snakes. The man’s shoulder reached the top of
the rail, and he held the letter carefully so that the
light beyond fell across it. It touched his own face,
too, and showed two deep furrows between his
brows, and the grey in his thick dark hair—such a
slight sprinkling from the hand of time that it
hardly showed unless in such a full light. Somewhere
in that lighted house his wife was busy over
feminine affairs of her own; she was not in this
front room, however, otherwise by lifting his eyes
he could have seen her. He was vaguely glad of
that even in the first shock of his surprise, for he
was always afraid of his own temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Ally had not begun that letter even in an informal
manner, or the “Dear Di” would have prevented
Major Churton reading further. It was unguarded
in its phrasing, and incriminating to a degree
in which he had never written before, because
he knew he was going away. To a jealous nature
there was no question as to the meaning of its
references; but just because Bute Churton knew his
own power of anger he was terribly just, and kept
an iron control over his judgment. He would not
be sure—not quite yet. He would wait and see if
the woman made this ugly suspicion a certainty by
any incautious speech on her part. He thought
for a moment of going down to the club now,
whence this had come, and dealing direct with
Lewin; but he was not sure—the letter he was
mechanically twisting and crushing in his strong
fingers was no proof of anything but a dangerous
intimacy—no literal proof at least—and there was
plenty of time to-morrow.</p>

<p>He looked down at the letter again, and tried to
piece the matter out. For years Di and he had
gone their own ways, and he had made no fuss over
the succession of men who had been her dubious
“friends,” because through some infatuated belief
in a man’s own wife being different from other
women, he had fancied that she was always on the
safe side—she had certainly always kept herself beyond
the range of scandal, if not gossip. Had the
theory of the thing even drifted through his mind,
as an indiscretion of the past, he might have shut
his eyes to it. It was as an actual experience of
the present that made it a hideous and impossible
position. A general tenet with regard to loose
morals is a very different thing to the example which
affects one personally. The most broad-minded
people in profession are generally the least charitable
in practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>He stood out there in the darkness until he had
regained his grip on himself, and thought that he
was cool. He could not re-read Ally’s letter, so he
put it in his pocket for further consideration, before
deciding to give it to Diana. Perhaps also he hoped
that Lewin’s departure meant nothing to her such
as the letter suggested; if she did not read Ally’s
urgent request to her to ride down and say good-bye
to him, it might not occur to her. He would
give her that chance.</p>

<p>They had already dined, and the table was cleared
and reloaded with the Tantalus and soda-water,
when he entered the dining-room. Diana came in
as he was helping himself to whiskey,—sparingly,
this time,—and flung her writing-case on to a distant
table with a movement suggestive of weary impatience.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> hot!” she remarked. “I’ll have some
claret and soda,—leave me some ice, Bute.” She
mixed it for herself, and spoke as she did so.
“Have you heard when the <i>Greville</i> is going?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see Captain Stern this morning at
the club?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He didn’t say.”</p>

<p>“Bother!” said Diana frankly. “I must telephone
through the first thing.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To the Lewins, of course. They will know.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The monosyllables did not warn her, for his voice
was perfectly under control. And his back was
towards her as he helped himself to another cigar
from the box on the sideboard.</p>

<p>“I’m going down to see old Ally Sloper off if he
goes in the middle of the night!” said Diana shortly.
The openness of the speech sounded brazen to him
to-night, for he forgot that yesterday it would have
passed him by. In her certainty of being secure
from his suspicion she took no trouble to disguise
her motives, and she was in some sort desperate also.
The feeling that had been half-hearted on Ally’s
side had grown to painful intensity on Diana’s until
her fondness for him made her as weak as he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“He will probably start early, and only his wife
will be there. I shouldn’t make myself an unwelcome
third if I were you.”</p>

<p>“Half the place will be there!” said Diana, with
an unnatural laugh. “You know we always turn
up to see the last of any one, it’s one of the few little
distractions left us. Of course I shall go—Chum
won’t mind.”</p>

<p>“I never argue,” said Churton, the cigar between
his teeth making the words sound ominously as if
he had set them. “All I have to say is that if I
were you—I shouldn’t go.”</p>

<p>For a minute she looked up sharply, and her
heart throbbed with fear of him. He was standing
at his full height, and though she was not a small
woman, he made her feel suddenly that his masculine
strength might be brutal—in any case that she
was but a child to him, physically. Then with the
old sore sense of injustice that has rankled in
woman from all generations, she set his sins beside
her own, and demanded dumbly if he could throw
the first stone, even though he knew! He did not
guess, of course—she would not harbour that idea;
but even if he did he had no right to accuse her.
She shut her lips in a hard line, and said no more.</p>

<p>Churton looked at her also for a moment. He
saw the hard, sun-scorched face and the embittered
lips, and perhaps he thought of the red-haired girl
he married. Diana was never untidy—her head was
as sleek and well-groomed now as a racer’s coat, and
below the collar-line her neck was milk-white where
her evening dress betrayed its original beauty. She
had the transparency peculiar to red-haired women,
and there was neither flaw nor fleck on her
shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>They went up to bed in silence, and the peace
between them remained unbroken. She could hear
him moving about in his dressing-room for a while,
but she was undressed and asleep before he lay down
by her side, and she was unaware that he lay hour
after hour, awake and thinking, piecing one thing
in with another, proving his own dishonour, and unconsciously</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Nursing his wrath to keep it warm.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He thought himself cool and collected, while the
smouldering fury in him burned steadily to white
heat. He had always been afraid of his own temper—it
was cheating him now.</p>

<p>Diana woke early, for she had fallen asleep wishing
to do so, and thinking that her husband was
still oblivious of her she slipped out of bed and began
to do her hair rapidly. She glanced at him
once, and saw that he was lying on his back as he
often did, the covering sheet thrown off him, and one
perfectly-moulded knee drawn up, which was also a
habit of his. He would sleep so, and she thought
his eyes were closed now without more than a cursory
glance. He was, in fact, not much in her
thoughts, though again it flitted across her mind
that his large supine limbs suggested terrible strength.
He was a splendidly-built man—as well built as
Alaric Lewin, though his added years had thickened
him somewhat—and even the raised knee was
rounded with a massive beauty that would have
pleased a sculptor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>By and by she found that the linen gown she
wanted hung in a closet outside her room, on the
other side of the passage. She slipped out almost
noiselessly to get it, and as she returned she heard
a clock somewhere in the house strike four. She
was in plenty of time, but the last report of the
<i>Greville’s</i> departure which had reached her had been
stated at five, and the grooms must saddle up for
her at once. She did not wait to telephone to the
Lewins after all, for fear of hindering herself rather
than otherwise. The thought occupied her mind,
so that when she re-entered the room she did not
notice that her husband had gone.</p>

<p>There was no time for a bath now, she could have
that later when she had ridden up the hill again,
and was dusty and hot. Ally would be gone then—gone
at least for a month, for no one expected
the trouble in East Africa to last longer. A month
was long enough—a month without Ally! She did
not realise that she had grown a foolish woman,
whose empty heart could not feed for ever on passing
attractions, and so craved greedily to really fill
itself, though with an unsatisfying love. Alaric
Lewin had been like a renewal of youth and its possibilities;
he was young and vital, and his very lack
of purpose made him seem like a boy far into his
manhood. She was clinging to the thought of him,
when she saw her husband enter quietly from the
dressing-room.</p>

<p>He was in his shirt, but the sleeves were rolled up
to the elbow over his muscled arms. He seemed to
have been washing, for he held a towel loosely in
one hand. She noticed vaguely that it was wet, or
had been dipped in water and wrung out. It
looked almost like a rope-end, twisted in that
way.</p>

<p>Conscious that her own shoulders were bare, she
resented the unusual intrusion of his entrance, and
turned on him curtly.</p>

<p>“I have not finished dressing,” she said. “You
can’t have this room yet. What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Why are you up so early?” he returned, as
curtly as she had spoken.</p>

<p>“I am going down to see the <i>Greville</i> off!”</p>

<p>“You <i>will</i> go?”</p>

<p>Her eyes met his, the hard brown of them reddish
with anger. “Yes, I will!” she said boldly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>He laid a tumbled letter before her, spreading it
out that she might see the familiar writing, and
speaking carefully, as though he picked his words.</p>

<p>“Captain Lewin’s bearer gave me this in the dark
last night, telling me it was for me—I could not see
the address, and he had evidently made a mistake,
for he insisted on my reading it. You can see for
yourself——”</p>

<p>He broke off, waiting with a terrible patience
while she glanced over the page. There was no
need to tell her more openly what she was to see,
but her face hardly altered save that it was frankly
insolent as she looked at him.</p>

<p>“I won’t say anything about your reading my
letters,” she said, “because you say it was by mistake.
The only thing I will say is that you have
no right to question me. I have never read any of
your letters, by mistake or otherwise, but——”</p>

<p>She flung the taunt at him, and saw his face
darken. Well, if there was to be a row she did not
mind much. Her rage at being found out, and the
pain of losing Ally at the same time, made her like
some fierce animal that turns to bay and longs to
fight. It would not be an open scandal—she knew
that instinctively. Let him do his worst!</p>

<p>He interrupted before she could accuse him further.</p>

<p>“That is beside the point. You will not go down
to see the <i>Greville</i> off.”</p>

<p>“I <i>will</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>He caught her by the arm, his fingers closing like
iron on the white flesh, and with his other hand he
brought the wet towel down heavily across her bare
shoulders. She was right in saying that it was the
equivalent of a rope-end—it had been tightly wrung
out, and it fell heavier than a rope. The long red
weals followed each cut, and she set her teeth under
the pain.</p>

<p>He had not said a word more, and she did not
cry out. It never occurred to her to struggle, for
she was like a child in his grip, and it would but
have completed her humiliation. The hot anger
and grief in her heart swelled up and choked her,
and the temper he had justly feared blinded him.
The first he knew of the weight of his own blows
was his wife slipping quietly to his feet, her bruised
shoulders a sickening witness to his strength.</p>

<p>He lifted her and laid her in bed again, drawing
the sheet over her up to her neck. Then he closed
the shutters and barred out the dreadful daylight,
and before he left he mechanically sprinkled her
face with water and saw the colour coming back to
her lips. Di was too strong to swoon like other
women—she had never gone off like this before, except—except
at Agra when the child died. He
was not sorry as yet; he did not feel anything except
a grim satisfaction that she would not attempt
to see the <i>Greville</i> off now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>He finished dressing and ordered his own pony,
riding off in the cool of the morning to the town.
He had not heard, as his wife had, of the cruiser’s
probable departure at daybreak, for her information
had come from Mrs. Ritchie Stern the day before,
and in Lewin’s letter he had not been sure when
they would go—at least, he had said he was not
sure. When Major Churton rode on to the wharf
the first reaction came over him and took the momentary
form of disappointment, for fading out of
the harbour, her smoke a trail on the horizon, was
the cruiser, and he saw that he was too late. Then
the other view of what he had done rose before him,
and the blind passion that had driven him into immediate
revenge on the person nearest at hand
seemed to die out with the <i>Greville’s</i> smoke trail.
He should have dealt with the man first, not with
that poor woman, whose hinted accusations were
true enough when one was cool to listen to them.
He had been too angry to heed, and his conscience
did not accuse him of vices more than other men’s,
while it had seemed to him that she was worse than
many wives. He had been unjust to begin with—brutal
to end with. In his stupid rage he had let
Lewin go scot free, while the woman bore the brunt
of it. His eyes followed the <i>Greville</i> over the edge
of the horizon with the keener humiliation because
he was a strong man with the reserve which many
years had taught him, and it was bitter to realise
himself in the wrong. He had believed in his own
manliness at least; now he felt that he despised himself,
and he was too honest to prevaricate.</p>

<p>There were not many people on the wharf, for
Captain Stern’s movements had been left uncertain
until the last moment. Mrs. Ritchie Stern and Mrs.
Lewin were standing together close to the water’s
edge, as if unanimously they had pressed after the
ship as far as they dared. Their ponies were held
at a little distance, Liscarton’s vagaries making it
unsafe to take him very near the unguarded edge of
the quay. The Commissioner was there too, and
Arthur White and Brissy Nugent, no one else. It
was White who saw the motionless figure of the O.C.T.
first, and rode up to him.</p>

<p>“Ah, Churton! You were too late,” he said,
shaking hands cordially. “I was afraid you might
be. It’s an awful pull to get down from Maitso so
early.”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>The grave face under the white helmet made the
Attorney-General leap to a wrong conclusion.</p>

<p>“Were you ordered out last night? No? Heard
nothing of the row?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“Where was it?” The steady, dark eyes came
back from the last glimpse of the <i>Greville</i> and fixed
themselves on White’s red pleasant face.</p>

<p>“At Government House. Halton has just been
telling me. He knew nothing of it, any more than
I, for he rode down to see me last night, and didn’t
get back until eleven or half-past. I’m to meet the
Administrator later, but I don’t suppose I shall
hear much more. He makes light of it—says it
was a flash in the pan, and rather amusing, but I
know I shouldn’t have cared to face a couple of
hundred niggers after the ultimatum about the
crops. I’m going to ask Mrs. Lewin what really
happened.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lewin!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she was in it all. Lewin had gone down
to the club to say good-bye to you all, I suppose—you
missed him, by the way?” (“Yes!” said
Churton bitterly, “I am sorry I did!”)—“and Mrs.
Lewin heard something of the disturbance and got
in a funk and rushed up to Government House.
Very sensible thing to do, only unfortunately she
got into the middle of it.”</p>

<p>This was Gregory’s very natural explanation of
her presence there, as Mrs. Lewin had already
found. She accepted it dully, with an added feeling
of fear at his facility. Churton’s eyes wandered to
her for a minute across the quay, and he thought
she looked as if last night’s strain and this morning’s
parting had tried her, and was gentler than
usual in his manner when she greeted him.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you arrived too late to see Ally,”
she said, “he hoped to catch you at the club last
night. I was to say good-bye for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>He thought of that helpless figure with scarred
shoulders that he had laid on the bed, but he did
not wince. His voice, as he asked her about the
trouble at Government House, was so kind and
sympathetic, that it came to nearer making her
break down than all that had gone before.</p>

<p>“I was very much frightened,” she said.
“Though Mr. Gregory says that there was no
danger. He cleared the stoep with a shambok—that
was all!” She tried to smile, and her eyes
were rather misty.</p>

<p>“You look as if you had had about enough of
it!” he said, unconscious of the effect of the morning
sunlight on his own face. He wished too that
she had not, with her few words, drawn him a picture
of Gregory and the shambok—it reminded him
of his own action this morning. Men like himself
and Gregory—men proud of their masculine quality
of strength—seemed of a brutal type to him just
now.</p>

<p>“I feel rather as if I had been to three balls all at
once, and danced into daylight—that is all. Dissipation
always gives me the same cheap feeling as a
great strain. Mrs. Stern is coming home to breakfast
with me to cheer me up, she is leaving in the
mail this afternoon, unfortunately, or I should try
and persuade her to stay for a few days.”</p>

<p>“I hear there is another cruiser signalled at Port
Albert,” said Mrs. Ritchie, as she turned from
Arthur White, to whom she had been talking.
“The <i>Skate</i> I think it must be—I suppose you all
know Captain Tullock? The bay will be quite
lively this afternoon with our departure and his
arrival. I shall see your wife then, of course, Major
Churton?”</p>

<p>“She is seedy this morning, but she may feel well
enough to come down,” he said composedly.
“Good-bye, Mrs. Lewin, take care of yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>She wondered why he was so particularly kind
to her, and if he would have been could he only
have known all the inward workings of her heart!
Life would be a little humiliating were it not for its
power of secrecy. As Bute Churton’s big figure
disappeared along the narrow street to the town,
Leoline looked after him and guessed nothing of
the irony of their relations with each other, for he
was thinking that worthless fellows like Lewin were
blessed with wives like this, while she shrank from
a consciousness of thoughts disloyal to her husband.</p>

<p>“Major Churton looks very ill!” she said. “I
never noticed it before; but I am sure he ought
to get away. I have grown selfish with my own
concerns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“He looks as if he had had some kind of shock,”
said Mrs. Ritchie, with her fatal intuition. “I
wonder what made him late!”</p>

<p class="noindent">“When two have set their minds on each other, a hundred cannot

</div>


<p>The confidence of two young married women is
amongst the most interesting experiences to be
obtained; but it is about as easy to get at by an
outsider as a Masonic ceremony of initiation. For
a time they are bound to skirmish over the surface
of facts, and compare notes on their households.
From this they may advance to their husbands, but
it is not till they reach Themselves and their own
point of view that they are really instructive. Had
Mrs. Ritchie Stern been remaining in Key Island, it
is possible that she and Mrs. Lewin might have
reached that stage when a broken sentence conveys
more to the sympathetic hearer than a whole explanatory
treatise would do to one who had not the
key to such mysteries. But the hours she spent at
the bungalow were too contracted for this; only the
stress of their mutual circumstances could have
made them get as far as stage number two, for they
did talk of their husbands.</p>

<p>“I am glad Alaric has gone with Captain Stern,”
Leoline said frankly, because she had something to
conceal in her piteous knowledge of Ally. “It
makes the journey at least so much less tedious.
And I hope they will be pals—that is my husband’s
inevitable word, so you must excuse it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“It is so much more expressive than friends, or
even chums,” said Mrs. Ritchie pensively. “To
‘pal’ always suggests a comfortable arm-in-arm
state of intimacy, eh?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! Ally makes friends rather easily.”
The last words were almost abrupt.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Ritchie is so good at that as at
listening. If you know what I mean, other men
make friends with him, and he listens. I should
think Captain Lewin was always very popular.”</p>

<p>“Invariably. I cannot remember, on looking
back through my life, any single person who knew
Ally and disliked him.”</p>

<p>“It is rather a fatal gift at times,—if you do not
mind my saying so.”</p>

<p>Chum did not answer directly. She spoke with
a touch of unintentional wistfulness. “Captain
Stern gave me a sense of such innate control. He
is like one of those Biblical examples that are
greater by reason of ruling themselves than the
noisier men who take cities. It always struck me
as such a very sane ideal.... I hope he will
be a friend of Ally’s!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ritchie looked at her with the full bounty
of her nature, and her words were not so irrelevant
as they seemed.</p>

<p>“My eldest boy is like me rather than his father,
and I am quite sorry! It is dreadful to have to
look out for your own little failings, and recognise
them. They seem such much more nasty little
things in some one else; and yet I always know
that they are just mine.”</p>

<p>“You must hate leaving the children!” said
Mrs. Lewin slowly—just as Blanche had meant her
to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Yes!” she responded. “But I would rather
have them, though on the other side of the world.
Just as I would rather have my sailor, even though
I cannot always follow his ship.”</p>

<p>“Captain Lewin has a great objection to having
children while he is on foreign service—particularly
in a hot climate,” said Leoline quietly. She was
looking down, her long lashes a brown shadow on
her unflushed cheeks, and her manner was too composed
for resignation. Suddenly she raised her eyes
with a flash that seemed to come all across the
room to Mrs. Ritchie.</p>

<p>“I was so awfully disappointed!” she said,
almost in a whisper. “At first I longed for
one——”</p>

<p>Her voice trailed into silence. Mrs. Ritchie held
her breath. The hint of being contented with
things as they were now frightened her.</p>

<p>“You will not always be abroad—at least in such
places as this,” she said hurriedly.</p>

<p>“No. One begins to see though, that there are
more selfish advantages to be gained from married
life without a nursery. It isn’t that Ally doesn’t
want children—he will some day. But then—I
mightn’t, you see.”</p>

<p>“You will,” said Mrs. Ritchie consolingly. “Let
alone the feeling you will have that you ought to
(I wish we didn’t have these feelings, but women
keep the conscience of the household, always!),
you will want to because it is natural. You needn’t
be afraid.” She waited a minute, meeting those
shining eyes steadily, and reiterated, “You needn’t
be afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Leoline turned her face to the window, and looked
across the garden, with its hot, dusty roses, to the
latched gate through which Ally had gone to, and
come from, Government House. At the gate a
shadow stood, and a voice said, under breath, “I
never came this way—before!” She thought of
the child denied her because of Ally’s selfish fear of
discomfort, and the safeguard of its presence in her
arms now; for she might be called in this a good
woman, that had she been a mother, she would not
have been afraid, not even of that dangerous proximity.
As it was, in spite of Blanche Stern’s presence
throughout the day, there was a horribly lonely
feeling about the bungalow, and after the rush of her
departure had died away, the empty rooms seemed
as if they listened for a step. The fear of being
alone and of listening also made Leoline Lewin insist
on riding down to the harbour again to see her
off, and for the second time in twenty-four hours
she found herself loitering about on the wharf
among the walls of coal, waiting with that horrible
sense of departure for the boat to start. There is
nothing more trying to those left behind than one
of these lingering “send-offs”—the going on board
and forced little conversations with one ear always
attentive for the bell and “Any more for the shore?”—the
interminable time of standing about on the
quay while the mails are got in, and the boat turns
so very slowly from the shore—the waving of handkerchiefs,
and hollow cheering, and then the going
home with a blank feeling that life is just the same
in its dull grooves, and all the chance of movement
and adventure has gone out with the ship beyond
the horizon line. It is a particularly depressing
ceremony in Key Island, whose inhabitants feel it a
prison at the best of times, but it seems to possess
a kind of hideous fascination to the residents, who
never let a boat depart without thronging on the
quay and wishing vainly that they were going with
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>There was a much larger gathering to see Mrs.
Ritchie off than there had been for the <i>Greville</i>.
The Gilderoys, Captain Nugent, the Arthur Whites,
Miss Denver, Mrs. Clayton with the gunner’s boy
in tow,—Mrs. Lewin counted them over with
wearied eyes and found none missing save the
Churtons. They were not there and Captain Gilderoy
amicably suggested that Diana had got a headache
from too many céhos, and the Major was
forced to stay away to cover her indisposition.</p>

<p>“But does she drink, Captain Gilderoy?” Mrs.
Clayton asked eagerly, her pretty vulgar face thrust
up to his. She had experienced the roughness
of Diana’s manner when there was no need to be
ingratiating, and sought for the joints in her
armour.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that, Mrs. Clayton!” Captain Gilderoy
raised his cynical eyebrows, and smiled as a
dog snarled, on one side of his mouth. His “smiling
acquaintance” with Mrs. Clayton had developed,
with no desire on his part, to a more conventional
one, and a further knowledge of her had intensified
his sentiments with regard to her rather than otherwise.
He disliked Mrs. Clayton every bit as much
as he did Mrs. Churton, and his comments on her
freedom from social restrictions were at least as
withering as on Diana, but that Eva Clayton had
not the capacity to guess. “I did not say she
drank,” he said in his most pleasant manner, “but
she has the advantage of a strong head! She can
take two drinks to my one; I have seen her get
through two tumblers of whiskey and soda when I
stopped prudently at the second.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” Mrs. Clayton’s loud, vacant
laugh jarred after Gilderoy’s polished words—he
spoke charmingly, and his voice was deep and
rather sweet,—and she caught her gunner by the
arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Rennie, listen! Captain Gilderoy says that
Mrs. Churton drinks—that’s why she isn’t here to-day.
She can toss off five whiskeys faster than the
men. Disgusting, isn’t it!”</p>

<p>Young Rennie was a fresh-faced boy, with eyes
which still danced carelessly with youth. All Mrs.
Clayton’s tuition had not yet left its impress on
his smooth, flushed face, but it was tainting his
tongue.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he said. “What fun! I’ll have a
drinking match with her one night—get her well
on and stake glass for glass.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” Mrs. Clayton said eagerly. “It would
be so amusing!” and Miss Denver turned round
and laughed too, but without spite. She was a
very tall girl, whose clothes were always a bad
copy of the last garrison lady’s who had come to
the Station, and there was a certain exuberance
about her that made women—nice women—say
that she had something maternal even in her generous
girlhood. Men, being coarser or more practical,
called her a finely-built girl, and thought of the
children she might bear them.</p>

<p>Leoline Lewin heard the comments on Di and the
laughter, and moved by instinct a little nearer Mrs.
Stern. Perhaps she was out of tune with her world
to-day, but it seemed to her as if the whole of her
surroundings were shoddy,—the very tone of the
people was like the little native huts with their lack
of stability and general uncleanness. When Brissy
Nugent appeared at her side, as if her husband’s
absence constituted him her cavalier, she turned
away almost like a pettish child with a feeling of
aversion to his familiar burnt face and immaculate
riding dress. She felt as if she knew exactly what
he was going to say, too, before he said it; but
all Brissy’s conversation appeared the inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Old Ally Sloper must be somewhere about lat.
20 by now, I suppose,” he said, as they stood at the
liner’s stern, waiting with melancholy patience to
say good-bye to Mrs. Ritchie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Hope you won’t be very lonely.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” For the life of her she could not
avoid the little ironical question.</p>

<p>“Pity I’m not a woman, and then I could come
up and stay with you and keep you company—eh?
Wouldn’t there be a lot of talk?”</p>

<p>“If you were a woman?”</p>

<p>“No, as we are. You knew what I meant, Mrs.
Lewin.”</p>

<p>Oh, this wearisome talk that led nowhere, and
always had a vacant laugh in it. And the sameness
of the fringe of ravenalas lifting solemn hands
along the shore—and the blue bay—and the zinc-roofed,
gim-crack town. She looked at the glare of
sunlight on Maitso and Mitsinjovy, and her eyes
ached, and then at the black walls of coal to cool
them, as she had done hundreds of times before.
They were all in the rat-trap, and her fellow rats
were no better off than she—save that perhaps the
others had not the soul-haunting sweet dread that
she had put behind her all day. For when she was
free of these people and went back alone to the
bungalow, there was nothing to prevent her thinking
of the nearness of Government House, and the
short cut through the grounds, while all the rooms
listened for a step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>She heard Hamilton Gurney urging some one to
come and drink a final cého with the U.C.L. men,
and her heart sank, for this was always a last ceremony.
Then Mrs. Stern came up and said good-bye,
her blue eyes very large and gentle, with their
strange gift of divination, and by a mutual impulse
the two tall women kissed each other. Even after
the boat had swung out into the harbour and passed
between the gates, Leoline stood watching it as she
had the <i>Greville</i> that morning, as if it carried away
yet another barrier of her safety, and lingered to
chat with one and another of her acquaintance.
Captain Gilderoy came up to ask her if she were
selling any of the ponies—she could not ride three
during Captain Lewin’s absence, and he rather fancied
Snapshot. She caught at the discussion, and
suggested his coming over one day to look at Nanton,
Ally’s last purchase.</p>

<p>“Will you come back with me now, you and Mrs.
Gilderoy?” she said, with a strange eagerness.
“And dine? I am very much alone.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I wish we could, but we are bound to
the Jacksons’.”</p>

<p>“Are they at By-Jovey? Another night then.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>No hope of rescue there! They all seemed to be
engaged, those who had useful wives, and the unattached
men she would not ask, with the pattern
of Mrs. Clayton and Miss Denver before her eyes;
for, as Mrs. Clayton passed her with Mr. Rennie,
Leoline heard the latter say, “I’ve got the hump
with that boat going—haven’t you? Let’s go up
to the Denvers’ and make a noise!” Mrs. Lewin’s
lips curled a little. She would not make her house
into a recreation ground for the idle men of the
Station, even though of better manners and more
intellectual tastes than this fresh-faced boy, who
after all, was harmless enough in his ill-breeding.
“Let’s go up to the Denvers’ and make a noise”
was no worse than “Let us drop in on Mrs. Lewin
because her husband is away.” No, such help as
that would not do. She must face it alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>The shadow of Tsofotra, the Sunset Gate, stretched
far across the sea as she gathered up her reins and
rode home by herself, with so little attention to the
way she went that Liscarton took advantage to
snatch a hasty supper from the low bushes and tall
grass, munching as he went, and expectant of a call
to order that did not come. Mrs. Lewin had other
thoughts to fill her mind, and as she sat at her
solitary dinner, she faced the new problems of her
existence with saddened eyes. It seemed to her
as if her life “were all read backward,” and her intentions
twisted by providence to a horrible issue.
She had been honest in her desire to spur her
husband on to success, and her first efforts to attract
Gregory had been actually on his behalf; but where
had she gone astray? For the original strategy of
arousing his interest for Ally’s sake, coupled with a
little innocent enjoyment of her own power no
doubt, had gradually altered its quality to a personal
pleasure in the companionship of a stronger nature,
and so she had drifted to this dangerous brink of a
new relation between them. Looking back, it
seemed to her as if all the mischief had sprung from
that night when she left her husband in a drunken
sleep to cover his incapacity as best she might with
the Administrator. And yet that night at least she
had hardly realised that Gregory existed as a man:
he was nothing but a power to be feared. She
could not see the natural development of the situation
from the affinity of such natures as Gregory’s
with her own, which was its feminine complement.
All that her mind could grasp was the plain fact
that bound in duty and honour to a man to whom
she had submitted the most sacred rights of her
womanhood, her very nature yearned treacherously
away from him to another who stood for ever beyond
the pale. Alaric had shown himself a weak
man, and represented the failure of her life; but it
was her instinct to hide her failures, and to make
the best of her own action in marrying him, rather
than to ask the world’s sympathy and justify herself
in infidelity. Where neither teaching nor principles
would triumph over Nature, her dear self-respect
stands like a guardian angel to such a woman as
Leoline Lewin, and becomes a giant virtue.</p>

<p>She took some work and moved into the further
room when her dinner was over, a very gracious
feminine figure with the atmosphere of civilisation
about her dainty gown and <i>chic</i> head, contrasting
strangely with the lawless tropical world outside the
open windows. All the danger of the sensuous
Earth seemed to be threatening her out of the night
and its insinuating scents,—all the safety of convention
to be inside the pretty room with its electric
light where she sat. As the monotonous needle
passed through and through the silk, she was schooling
herself to fearlessness, and soothing her own
nerves by the occupation, until she ceased to start
at a rustle on the garden paths, and was no longer
haunted by that mad fear of one man’s approach.
So composed had she grown at last, that she missed
the very step that she had expected along the stoep,
and the opening of the door by the butler. The
first intimation she had that her fate was hard upon
her was Abdallah’s voice announcing the Administrator
almost as he withdrew to his own quarters again.</p>

<p>She put aside the work on her lap carefully, running
the needle in and out the silk that she might
not lose it, and rose without hurry, every precious
second gained helping her to recover her breath,
which seemed to have been swept away by the
sound of his name. As she came forward to meet
her guest there was not a tremor about her, nothing
but the composed grace of a well-bred woman in
her own house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>Gregory had stood still under the electric lamps;
the light was strong in spite of the soft red shades,
and it seemed to show them to each other in merciless
revelation. He held out his hand to take hers
in conventional greeting, and let it go again after
the legitimate few seconds during which palm rests
in palm. They had not really spoken to each other,
save in broken disturbed sentences, since the Deputation
interrupted his avowal of his reason for sending
Lewin away alone. It seemed to her that they
must take it up just there, as if nothing had intervened,
and she sought desperately for something to
avert it. The hours that lay between his whispering
voice, saying that he could not part from her,
and the present moment rolled back into nothingness.
They were not, and this sentence to be answered
still seemed to hang in the air.</p>

<p>“I saw Captain Lewin off this morning,” she said
baldly, as if proving that what he had said was true.
He could not part from her—well, he had not. In
another sense, the sentence was a warning that questioned
his right to be there. “I saw Captain Lewin
off this morning—I am alone!” added the significant
pause.</p>

<p>“I know.” He did not deny the accusation of
his having paid her a visit at this late hour, if she
intended to insinuate it. He accepted it rather, and
a clock struck nine in the further room as if to punctuate
and affirm his acceptance.</p>

<p>Then there was one of those strange pauses which
seem like the visible boundary between one phase
of existence and another—the possible crossing the
rubicon, the possible drawing back and remaining
in safety. It comes before many a declaration,
while Mr. Brown and Miss Smith are still conscious
of their former titles, though the next instant may
convert them into John and Jane to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>
<p>For just that brief pause Gregory and Leoline
stood facing each other in the strong artificial light.
Then, as though drawn by something much stronger
than the restraint of convention, they moved nearer
never breaking that long painful gaze until something
that seemed like a sigh passed through the
room, as though for relief that the tension was relaxed,
and their lips met. Neither could tell exactly
how that kiss came about. It was so inevitable,
once it was done, that there seemed no cause
for it. The embrace was a thing that belonged to
their lives as much as their vitality. To the woman,
however, it was a mental thing, and seemed a decision
of her brain as to what shall become of all
her further life; but the man was conscious of the
warmth of her mouth, the very breath of her life
mingling with his.</p>

<p>The modes of artificial society would demand a
word of explanation before such a stride in intimacy
between the sexes as is meant by a kiss. There
should be a request for permission to go further—anything
to soften the extreme suddenness of the
change of attitude. But Nature is too ready for us
in a crisis; she does not use the acquired power of
speech, but the instinctive one of action. Gregory
had said no word at all of explanation or apology—two
ornaments of plain speaking which belong emphatically
to civilisation! He was a savage for the
time being, and used the methods of the primeval
man with the single improvement of gentleness.
There was no roughness of passion in that instinctive
embrace; nothing but the irresistible attraction
of the two pairs of lips to each other, until, satisfied,
they parted as simply as they had met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Almost before she was conscious that he had
loosened her Leoline found that he was leading her
across the room to a low-cushioned lounge, his arm
still guiding her, and as she seated herself he sat
down beside her side. His breath came a little
thickly, but his iron self-control was instanced in his
quiet voice when he spoke.</p>

<p>“Now we will talk this out!”</p>

<p>“Is there anything to say?” she asked almost in
a whisper. Now that the natural moment was over
she shrank before the acknowledgment of her own
action. All her habit of convention came back to
her and shamed her horribly, though she would not
deny, even to herself, the new position she felt she
had taken, and still meant to take.</p>

<p>“There is a great deal to say,” he said in that decisive
suppressed voice that had never been more
characteristic. “We have neither of us come to
this without thinking what it means.”</p>

<p>“I know. And yet there seem so many other
things to hold by—honour, decency, self-respect,
justice (for what has my husband done that he
should be my sacrifice?), perhaps even the fear of
God.”</p>

<p>“You will find all these included in what I feel
for you. Do you think I am offering you a little
trivial passion—a thing of the senses, that will only
last a day?”</p>

<p>“Does it make any difference when the effect on
others is the same? Some one must suffer through
my disloyalty—that is the real stumbling-block.
Will any feeling of yours, however sacred to us
both, alter the fact that I am another man’s wife?”</p>

<p>“Even that is not an impassable barrier. Such
ties have been broken before.”</p>

<p>“You are asking me——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>“I am not asking you for anything you might
not give if you were an unmarried woman—as yet.
How am I to make you understand? If I had
wanted you for my mistress I should have told you
so long ago. At least you could only have given
me my <i>congé</i>. I don’t understand beating about
the bush, if that is all that one wants of a woman,
because it can’t be much loss if she says no—there
are a great many more who will say yes!”</p>

<p>She thought of her husband’s often assertion that
“every woman in the island had had a try for
Gregory’s Powder,” and winced to see that he had
appreciated his own power of choice—if he had
chosen. She almost hated her own sex for giving
him some ground at least for the brutality of his
speech, and herself for listening to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“With you,” he went on, with that same terrible
finality of a statement that could not be questioned,
“it is different. I should be depreciating my own
property. Some day I mean to make you my
wife”—he drew a breath, and added her name, as
if to say it were a natural joy—“Leo!” he whispered,
the familiar contraction of Leoline giving her
a little thrill of pleasure, even while it seemed dreadful
to her that she felt she had no right to flinch
from his bold statement. She had not thought over
the situation without facing such an issue, as he had
seen was inevitable, and she was too honest and too
strong herself to weakly cry out that she had not
considered this, or made up her mind. She had
counted the cost to Alaric Lewin and to herself;
perhaps passion weighed down the scale in which
she placed her own risk, but she knew that her decision
had been tacitly in favour of such a step as
Gregory prognosticated to her mind by speaking of
her as his wife. There was just one terrible difference
in their point of view that she could not realise;
his words simply meant to her the horrible publicity
and degradation of the Divorce Court—but in
his mind was that olden letter of which his own
seemed a reflex—</p>

<p>“Set Uriah in the forefront of the battle ...
that he may die....”</p>

<p>All the wrong against her husband that was credible
to her was done to his name. That Alaric
must suffer from the blow she saw, and knowing no
injury that he had done her, it seemed an intolerable
thing that she meditated in cutting the tie between
them. She knew him for a weak man too; what
would be the result, to a nature like his, of her desertion?
If every fibre in her heart had not seemed
to her to be rooted in the man beside her, she would
never have permitted herself the choice; but for the
time being her whole soul was in revolt, demanding
its desire, crying out that its very life depended on
the chance of happiness. She could not argue or
reason just now; she felt the necessity of her own
being a greater thing than the slighter nature’s pain.
Was she always to be sacrificed to Alaric’s weakness?
her heart cried out impatiently—Ally, who
was as easily comforted as a child by a new toy for
the one that had been broken! Within a week of
her flight he would be playing tennis, and petted
and consoled by other women for his unmerited
misfortune. She saw him more harshly than ever
before, and her velvet eyes grew sombre as she
raised them to Gregory’s watchful face. There was
no remorse or vacillation in him—there would be
no repining word hereafter. What he did he had
stood by all his life, and he neither excused nor forswore
himself. He was a hard man at worst—a
strong man at best. Some day she would know
him for unscrupulous, but always and for ever she
would love him, because his qualities were the essential
for her, and also because love goes deeper
than reason and outruns rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“I am not asking you to take such a step to-morrow
or next day,” he urged in that under-breathed
voice, “only it would be unfair not to set
my ultimate goal before you.” Then his manner
grew warmer, he half leaned against her lace-clad
shoulder, and his arm stole around her waist. “Is
it so hard to think of me as a husband, darling? I
believe you are half afraid of me as a lover!”</p>

<p>She felt the masculine eyes above her dominating
her, and her head drawn back against his shoulder.
As he kissed her again and again, closing the velvet
eyes and holding her lips with his own until she was
breathless, his constraining clasp gradually bound
her close to him. Through the thin linen suit she
could feel every tightened muscle of his body, and for
a moment was blinded by his caresses. She had not
realised until then the feebleness of her own passions
compared with his. It seemed as if he were built
upon such a gigantic scale that lesser mortals dwindled
beside him as beside one such as the old Greeks
used to believe was endowed by a deity in parentage.</p>

<p>But when she slipped out of her gown that night
she was conscious of a painful soreness, as though
her soft elastic flesh had been badly bruised. There
was no mark on the white skin, but she could not
pass her hand down her side without feeling the
hurt. It could not have been a blow, for a blow
would have left a visible bruise. Yet her very muscles
ached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>For a moment, as she rubbed her hand softly to
and fro over the warm satin surface of her body, she
could not understand the cause. Then her face
flamed. She was half ashamed and half exultant.
For she realised the strength of Gregory’s clasp, and
felt as Danaë may have felt in the grip of her god.</p>

<p>“There must be something wrong between the
Churtons,” said Mrs. Gilderoy, taking off her hat
and sitting down beside Mrs. Lewin to chat.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Leoline, in some
surprise. “I haven’t seen Di for ever so long,
though all the rest of you have been most good in
cheering my solitude. Major Churton is away,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He has gone for a ride round the island. That
is how I know something is wrong. It is our one
resource for mental disturbance—if a man has been
refused, or a woman found out, they arrange to ride
round the island until things calm down again.
You see, we can’t get out of it, so we begin to run
round and round to ease our distress.”</p>

<p>“Like rats in a trap!” said Mrs. Lewin absently,
her mind with Halton’s simile.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Churton said he was going to shoot
on the Tableland, but young Rennie, who went out
there some days later, found him starting for Africa
Point and Sand Bay. He will come home by
Hashish Valley, and I hope he won’t come in for
the trouble there!”</p>

<p>“There is no further disturbance, is there? Mr.
Halton told me positively that he would leave in
the next mail. But that may be desperation!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Poor man! I don’t wonder. He has been kept
hanging about on the chance of a rising, when he
might just as well have gone by the same boat as
Mrs. Ritchie Stern. Look how tamely the snuff-coloured
people took the crop-burning, after all!”</p>

<p>“Rather ominously so, I thought. I feel somehow
as if we were not through yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, what there was to see, you saw! I can’t
think how you lived through that night at Government
House, Chum. I expected to see your hair
grey next morning.”</p>

<p>“It was really not so terrifying as it sounded
afterwards. Mr. Gregory was so cool too—he was
almost insolent to the natives.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you expected to find Captain Lewin
there. You have not heard anything of him, by
the way—I mean cabled through from Capetown,
for instance—have you?”</p>

<p>“Not a word. All I know is that the boat
reached Port Cecil, and it was also confirmed that
his regiment was up there.”</p>

<p>“So he will have his friends about him, anyway.
It is a month since he left, isn’t it? Aren’t you
very anxious?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so. It would be so unreasonable,
because I know that I could not hear. If he
wrote at once <i>viâ</i> Capetown the mail will bring it.
But Ally is a bad correspondent, and if he were
very much taken up with the business in hand he
might forget and miss the mail. And I might
never hear at all until he came back!”</p>

<p>“You take it very philosophically. I know if I
didn’t hear from my good man under the circumstances,
I should begin writing abusive letters to the
Government at Capetown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“I think they find Key Island quite enough of a
worry, without having to calm disaffected wives
there, as it is,” said Mrs. Lewin, with a pang of
conscience. How often had she thought of Ally
through these halcyon summer days that had drifted
past her so softly and easily—they seemed, on looking
back, merely a golden haze? She had thought
of him, indeed, as the fly in her amber, and had
thrust the thought away when conscience pressed
too hard. “I can’t think why they brigaded us
with South Africa,” she added, more to dodge her
own thought than with any real interest in the Home
Government’s disposal of the Empire. “Mauritius
has its own governor; why shouldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“We are too small. And besides, they never
give Gregory’s Powder an absolute monarchy—perhaps
when he goes Key’land will be made a
Crown colony. I am sorry for Capetown having
such a firebrand tacked on to them, myself. He
was under Milner once, and they nearly quarrelled;
but the man of men he hates is Kitchener. Gregory
always wants the troops at his instant disposal
when he sets out to soothe the wily native, and
Kitchener won’t have it. Can’t you imagine Gregory
trying to snatch a few soldiers when the General
is not looking, and the poor wretched officer in
command being dragged in two, like a Christmas
cracker, between them?”</p>

<p>“And going off with a bang,” said Mrs. Lewin,
laughing. “I am sure I should, in his place. Mr.
Gregory started in the Army himself—you know
that, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I believe he served with Roberts for a
short time—a <i>very</i> short time! He never could
obey his senior officers. So he was taken out of
the Army and put into the Colonial service.
Apropos of nothing, Chum, you are not looking
well. When are you going to Vohitra?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“I am too much afraid of your thinking it a
proof of mental disturbance,” said Mrs. Lewin, with
a languid smile. “When people ride round the
island it always begins at Port Albert, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Generally; though in very bad cases I have
known them ride right through the Rano Valley,
and up to Vohitra that way—on some one else’s
pony, of course. Do you notice that the pony is
the pledge of affection here? We don’t give engagement-rings—we
give ponies. ‘He has given
her a pony’ is tantamount to saying, ‘they are engaged,’
and if you ride any man’s cattle save your
husband’s you are accepting serious attentions.”</p>

<p>“What a dreadful thought! For we have never
really bought Liscarton, Captain Nugent <i>would</i>
lend him to me, and I am so dishonest that I have
not returned him yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, it is such a known thing that
Bristles worships your untied shoestrings, and hangs
upon the tilt of your Panama, that no one would
be surprised if you took his entire stud!”</p>

<p>“I suppose I have no character!” said Mrs.
Lewin resignedly.</p>

<p>“Not a shred! You are much too good-looking,
and your clothes suggest Bond Street and general
wickedness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>Again Leoline laughed, for she was content that
Key Island should bracket her with Brissy Nugent.
Her conscience was nearly dormant during those
days, and only roused occasionally when a gust of
remorse or realisation swept over her reasonlessly
and made her shudder. Then it would pass, and
she would face the situation steadily again. Had
she been in England, among influences which had
moulded her life, and with the chance of a larger
outlook, she would not have deemed such a state
of mind as her present one to be possible to her.
That her whole self could be absorbed in a man
whom to love was frankly dishonourable, would
have seemed to her impossible while she had the
intelligence to foresee and fight it down. But it is
impossible in a land policed by the conventions of
countless generations, where at least one lives in
wholesome fear of one’s next door neighbour, to
realise or understand the influence of the waste
places of this earth under the sway of the Imperial
Government. Men lose their boundaries there, and
be a woman what she will she is bound to feel the
influence in her thoughts if not her actions. The
laxity of the manners and morals in such rat-traps
as Key Island is due to the opinion of the majority,
for sin is after all a matter of the law of nations,
and there is no universal standard of right and
wrong. When the thermometer stands at 90° in
the shade, and Society consists of forty persons
who must go on meeting each other indefinitely, it
is probable that the forty will tacitly agree to overlook
each other’s peccadilloes for the sake of comfort.
And it is hard to be less charitable to one’s
own failings than one’s neighbour will be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>The stronger nature with which she was in close
intercourse, too, was influencing if it could not entirely
dominate Leoline. Gregory had absolutely
kept his word with regard to their relations with
each other; he did not ask her for a material proof
of her affection, but it was not in human nature
that they should not be often together and alone
without some such hint of passion as had overtaken
them on the evening of Alaric’s departure. His
visits were spasmodic, and dependent to a certain
extent on caution while Halton was still at Government
House, but she never knew when he might
not appear, and had given herself up to receiving
him with a submission that yet kept her nerves on
edge. Sometimes they merely talked—intimately,
it is true, for he unfolded his plans to her as to no
one else—but with hardly a kiss to disturb her
pulses. It was a relief to Gregory to confide in a
mind which he found both receptive and capable of
following him, even of counselling him at times.
He made her the partner of plans he would not
have trusted to a fellow-man, and would have
missed her from his life as a confidante, apart from
her attraction as a woman; for the craving for sympathy
is as great as the craving for alcohol—once
aroused, it becomes a habit, and is hard to satisfy.
During the greater part of his life Gregory had
taught himself to live alone, and regard men and
women alike as likely to be a hindrance to him unless
he could make a passing use of them. Now he
had found a helpmate he meant to bind her to him
by the strongest tie he could fashion.</p>

<p>Leoline gave regally in the expansion of all her
forces, and made him the master of her brain and
spirit as well as heart. Every vital power she had
was at his disposal, and while she gloried in the bestowal
she was troubled that her sensations were
not all clear gain in perfect joy. The temperate,
uncomplicated affection she had felt for Alaric had
in a way made her less unhappy, if also less happy,
which was disturbing. Take it how one will, being
in love is not a comfortable process, provided it is a
real case of unreasoning attachment between two
human beings—unreasoning in that the advantages
of such an attachment do not influence the feeling
at all. No one really enjoys violent emotion, and
of all experiences a sexual love is most likely to be
violent, however it may differ in degree, through a
warmer or colder nature. “All pleasure is negative,”
says Schopenhauer, for the fulfilment of a
desire only concludes the pangs of it. Love as
purely, as mentally as one may, it is a torturing joy—a
bewildering experience that upsets and revolutionises
the ordinary routine of life, and which one
naturally resents. Who cares for the unused depths
of his being brought up to the surface, and forcing
him to live in extremes? It is the memory of love
which is divine; the present experience is by no
means so pleasant, and sooner or later brings the
pain that is only tolerable when it has passed.</p>

<p>On the day when Mrs. Gilderoy came to see her,
Leoline was looking forward to the arrival of the
mail with mixed feelings. It was due the next day,
and Alfred Halton was going to leave Key Island
by it, for there was peace in Hashish Valley and
China Town, and the natives of Port Victoria were
dully quiet, almost as if the burning of the crops had
been a salutary lesson and had cowed them. There
had been very little drunkenness in the streets of
late—always the prevailing sin of Key Island—and
thefts of cattle had been rare. So far things were
well, and the removal of Halton would be an unfeigned
relief, for Mrs. Lewin had an intuitive dread
of him that all the rest of the population could not
inspire. She had warned Gregory, who would
hardly be warned because of an instinctive contempt
at the roots of his nature for the man who had
always been afraid to act; but the boat that took
Alfred Halton out of her immediate life was as welcome
as a human rescuer, if it had not also brought
the mail. Mrs. Lewin dreaded the mail, and the
sight of her husband’s familiar handwriting. It
would force her to face her own intention again, to
consider their relations, and how she should deliberately
sever herself from him. While he was absent
there had been a certain pause in action that had
left her finally uncommitted. She did not mean to
flinch from the actual step, and yet she wished that
his return might be delayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>She had not expected the Administrator that
night, for he had been to Port Albert, and she had
not heard of his return. His visits were almost
always made in the evening after dinner, when he
could snatch a half-hour unobserved and likely to
be undisturbed, and his appearance on this occasion
was later than his usual hour. There was something
hurried and almost abrupt about his entrance
too, partly from the fact that he was in riding dress,
and it seemed as if he must have come straight from
his return journey.</p>

<p>She had risen rather hastily as Abdallah announced
him, and instinctively looked past his
broad shoulders to see the white turban vanish out
of sight before she greeted him. But he hardly
waited for safety, and drew her into his arms with
an unusual demonstration of passion. They stood
silent for a moment, and she was suddenly a little
faint. Either some desperate feeling in him communicated
itself to her, or the violent demand of
his nature sapped her strength. She had not the
resistance to draw her lips away, but it was a relief
when the interminable kiss was over. She gave an
odd little laugh to recover herself, and laid her hand
against his face with tender familiarity.</p>

<p>“You haven’t shaved to-day! How dare you
kiss me?”</p>

<p>“I know—I’m only just back. I came straight
in.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you been home?” she asked, startled.
“Haven’t you dined?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”—something seemed to strangle him in
the one word. “Yes—I—went home. No, don’t
call any one. I’m going back to Government House
to feed—later.”</p>

<p>“But, Evelyn”—her arms suddenly tightened
about his large loose figure; she looked up with a
beautiful white face—“have you bad news?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“No!”—he spoke the one word with no uncertainty,
but then he framed her face in his two hands
and looked hard into her eyes. “Do you know,”
he said fiercely, “I am tempted to break my word
to you!”</p>

<p>“How?”—but she knew in all her leaping blood.</p>

<p>“To make you rather more mine than I have a
right to yet, to-night.” For a minute it seemed
that his decision hung in the balance, while she
wondered blankly why her will seemed frozen, and
she could not say at once, as she must do, “I will
not!”</p>

<p>“If I let you off, promise me afresh to come
to me some day—when we are free,” he said
urgently, the assurance of his first words startling
her. “You will not throw me over for some
woman’s scruple—will you?”</p>

<p>Such uncertainty was even more unusual than his
taking her consent for granted, for he was anxious
now, pleading for what he had already gained, as if
there were some real fear of losing it.</p>

<p>“Evelyn, there is something troubling you!” she
exclaimed. “There <i>is</i> something wrong!”</p>

<p>“No, nothing—but say what I want. Promise
me——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That you are mine whatever happens. That
nothing shall stand between us.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, panic-stricken. All the responsibility
of such selfishness as he asked for weighed
upon her with a sudden burden.</p>

<p>“We have decided——” she began.</p>

<p>“No, but swear it——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Then his mood changed as strangely as it appeared
to have come upon him. He clasped her
waist with his arm again, and dropped his head
heavily against her breast. She almost staggered
under his massive weight, even though he held
her.</p>

<p>“No, I will ask nothing of you,” he said thickly.
“I will trust you to give me more than I deserve,
Leo—but you are free to choose. I am too hardened
a sinner for you to be bound to, or smirch
yourself with, perhaps. And yet—I love you—love
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>The cry was so genuine that it frightened her for
their safety, and she said “Hush” instinctively. His
face when he raised it was lined and scarred as if
with his own storm of feeling, and he looked harsher-featured
and more rugged than ever. Even after
he had regained his usual control and left her, she
kept going over the incident with a feeling of bewilderment.
It was the only occasion on which
she had seen him so upset, and he appeared to her
almost wild—almost as if possessed by some unlooked-for
remorse. She could but suppose that
their mutual relations stung his sense of honour, too,
at times, though it was a venial sin, but such a revelation
was almost pitiful to her, and, strange to say,
strengthened her own resolution to sacrifice the rest
of the world to him, as no appeal of his could have
done. Even the momentary danger she had been
in of a sexual advance in their relations with each
other did not alarm her as it had at the time. She
realised that the danger had been there, for Gregory’s
force of will had at times almost a hypnotic
influence upon her, and where she would once have
been confident in her own power of denial, she had
learned to doubt herself; but she realised also that
it was no mere access of passion and self-indulgence
that had made him desire a more complete possession
of her. For some reason he was afraid of a
possible break in the tie that bound them, and
wished to strengthen it by every means in his power.
He judged that, once master of her body, her morality
would be uneasy until he had an established
right to such privilege, and by foregoing that claim
he had weakened his own position with her. But
why should he doubt her resolution now, and why
be so suddenly anxious to secure her even to the
extent of compromising her honour?</p>

<p>The question troubled her waking thoughts, and
followed her even into her dreams. But she found
no answer to her own vague disquietude, and the
darker knowledge in Gregory’s mind was hidden
from her.</p>

<p>“Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle
... that he may be smitten, and die.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass, when Joab observed the
city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he
knew that valiant men were.</p>

<p>“And the men of the city went out and fought
with Joab; and there fell some of the people of
the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died
also.”</p>

<p>For, as Gregory had said, he had been home before
he came on to the bungalow, and there he
found that during his absence in Port Albert news
had arrived, and awaited him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>There had been a cable from Capetown.</p>

<p>The Post Office at Port Victoria is in the same
block of buildings as the Government Office, though
on a lower floor, and the busy staircase is thronged
by officials as well as people coming for their mail
or posting letters. There is no delivery in Port
Victoria, for two excellent reasons—local communication
is carried on solely through the telephone,
or notes by bearer, and on mail days the recipients
of letters besiege the office for their mail, long before
the sorting is over. Most of the residents have
a box, and prefer to call for their letters to having
them delivered, so the postman’s duties are a farce,
and by the time he goes his rounds he has no letters
to carry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>Bristow Nugent rode into town early that mail
day, but he had business at the A.S.C. yard, and at
the garrison office, and by the time he reached the
Post Office it was one o’clock, and his letters had
been waiting for him in the box for two hours. At
the foot of the rough staircase were a group of men
he knew—Arthur White, Archie Lysle the regimental
chaplain, the harbour master, Hamilton
Gurney, and young Rennie—and before he had
spoken a word to them their concerned faces had
told him that something was wrong. Although
knowing that his private affairs could not have
reached them before himself, his heart contracted
with the sick throb of fear peculiar to men stationed
in distant corners of the earth, and feeling themselves
helplessly out of reach of their nearest and
dearest, and the good-looking animal face under the
white helmet suddenly blanched.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he said characteristically.</p>

<p>“It’s Lewin——” the Attorney-General answered
as briefly and to the point as he was asked. “They
cabled from Capetown last night, and the details
are in to-day.”</p>

<p>“Lewin!—Ally!—what about him?”</p>

<p>“He’s dead!”</p>

<p>Nugent caught at the wooden banister as if
White had struck him, and turned sharply from
one to the other with the words he could not utter
on his lips. They answered his questions amongst
themselves without his asking them.</p>

<p>“He made a mess of things over the East African
business, and—and cleared out of it.” Young
Rennie spoke first, but shied off the explanation
like a frightened horse. There was some darker
meaning here than the natural fate which overtakes
any man. Nugent’s face grew sharper with
anxiety.</p>

<p>“Poor young fool!” said White. “He was the
wrong man in the wrong place. Fell in with his
own regiment too, and made a night of it—got
drunk most likely, and talked.”</p>

<p>“Talked Government secrets too—<i>Gregory’s</i> secrets!
There will be a devil of a row to hush up
now. Gregory may have to go himself.”</p>

<p>“Serve him right!” put in the little Chaplain
with unexpected savagery. “What did he want
sending a harmless fool like Ally into such a tight
place? It was Halton’s job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>“Lewin went away like a sick beast, poor devil,
somewhere into the interior.” It was Arthur White
who seemed to know by instinct the raging questions
Nugent could not frame, and answered them with
more coherence than the rest. “That was how it
was they never found him for so long, and the news
was delayed. It only came down to Capetown a
few days since, and the mail picked up Hanney’s
letter at Beira.”</p>

<p>“How did he die?” Brissy had found his voice
at last. The curt words surprised himself that they
should be in his ordinary tone. He had fancied,
with his throat dry and burning like that, that he
must be hoarse. “Was it fever or a scrimmage?”</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, and the men looked at
each other.</p>

<p>“Neither,” said White, without glancing at the
questioner. “He shot himself.”</p>

<p>“Funked it, by Jove!” The words came under
Brissy’s breath. He did not know what it was that
shocked him—the suggestion of cowardice to his
mind, or the staggering realisation of the extent of
Alaric Lewin’s indiscretion to have driven him to
such a course. It must indeed have been a disaster
that had made Ally see no way out of it, but to
take his own life. What, in God’s name, had he
been doing?</p>

<p>“Does his wife know?” he said roughly, in his
fear.</p>

<p>“Poor girl!—no, how should she?”</p>

<p>“Some one must tell her. It will leak out, and
she’ll hear it straight, if they don’t.”</p>

<p>“I pity the man who breaks it to her, that’s all!”
It was Rennie who spoke, and his tones were
heartfelt. “I wouldn’t for anything the world contains!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“Some one must.” Brissy set his white teeth and
looked from one to the other. There was no response
in their faces, and their eyes avoided his
rather than otherwise. In the pause a heavy step
sounded on the landing above, and the Administrator
himself appeared, leaning over the rail of the
stair. His gaunt form and harsh face showed not
one sign of weakness—hardly even of pity or concern—but
he signed imperiously to Arthur White.</p>

<p>“Can you come up and speak with me?” he
said. “I want you.”</p>

<p>As if by a common impulse all the men turned
and followed the Attorney-General up the stair, and
crowded into the narrow passage, looking with stern
earnestness into Gregory’s face. He held some letters
in his hand, and beyond him, through the open
door of the office he had just left, Alfred Halton’s
figure was just visible, seated by the open window.
It was so hot at this hour of the day—being barely
past the Miroro—and in the narrow passage between
the offices, that the sweat hung in beads round the
lips and on the temples of every man present, without
any movement or exertion on their part, while
the smell of the air seemed the essence of heat—a
baked atmosphere, without actual matter to flavour
it.</p>

<p>“We were speaking of Mrs. Lewin, sir,” said the
Attorney-General firmly. “Does she know of Captain
Lewin’s death?”</p>

<p>“Not unless some one has already ridden out and
told her, or she is in town.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t in town, I think, because her groom
came down at eleven and took out her mail.”</p>

<p>“She could not have heard through the mail, I
suppose?” said the Administrator quickly. “No,
of course not—there was nothing but the cable
from Capetown. My information came from Beira,
and Mrs. Lewin would not hear from there.”</p>

<p>“They do not know any details at Capetown
then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“No. Some one will have to break it to Mrs.
Lewin.”</p>

<p>Again that reluctant pause, while each man in
his own mind saw Chum as she had appeared to
him at some moment when she made the most
vivid picture of herself to him individually. So,
Rennie saw her on horseback, managing a fractious
pony—Arthur White recalled one evening when he
had seen her with his wife in the nursery, bending
over a child’s cot. Hamilton Gurney fancied her
in her own pretty shaded room, lying back against
some coloured cushions, while he sang to her,—but
no man offered to face her with such news as that
the Administrator held in the loose letters in his
hand.</p>

<p>It was Bristow Nugent who spoke at last,—the
least expected of the group.</p>

<p>“All right—I’m going.”</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, as if he could not wait to
think, and ran down the uncarpeted stairs, his spurs
clicking and jingling, and some metal trapping or
other adding to the audible hurry. Outside he
caught his pony by the mane, swung into the saddle
far quicker than he had ever done at a fourth
chucker on the Polo ground, and was tearing past
the stores and out towards Maitso Hill before any
one on the landing had quite realised that it was
Captain Nugent who had risen to the occasion.</p>

<p>“Bristles has no nerves,” said Rennie in selfish
excuse. “He was about the best man to go—he
won’t really care much. He’s stolid.”</p>

<p>“Pity you’re so sensitive,” retorted the Chaplain
cuttingly. “A little of Nugent’s stolidity might
do you good.... Lewin was his friend,
too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Such a thought was in Bristow Nugent’s mind all
through that dusty gallop up the tangled green road,
while the sweat poured down his brown face, and
his heart beat thickly with his errand. Memories
of Ally—old Ally Sloper!—at Sandhurst with him,
when they both came perilously near being
“chucked” because of a certain escapade connected
with a frying-pan and the senior captain’s banjo;—that
night too, when Forrester of the Duke’s
(Forrester always did lay it on so thick!) borrowed
his man’s uniform and went out with Ally as his
“girl,” Ally in a hat and feathers after the style of
a London flower-seller! Lucky thing they were
not spotted that time. And his own special breed
of fox-terriers from which Ally had that bitch he
was so fond of—what was her name? Kiddy—yes,
of course, after some girl on whom he was awfully
gone. Kiddy went to India with Ally, and he confessed
that he cried like a fool when she died from
a karait’s bite. He could understand that too—a
fellow got as fond of a dog as of a child. He
thought inconsistently of his own boy in England,
and wondered how he should feel if his unopened
letters contained bad news. Then his thoughts
harked back to Sandhurst—poor old Ally!...
Such stupid, lovable times!... Men make
tenderer friendships in their young manhood than
they care to express.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>He was covered with dust—caked with it—and
streaked with the heat as he dismounted in the stable
yard of the bungalow. Not the state in which
to go into a lady’s drawing-room, he thought ruefully,
pulling the handkerchief out of his sleeve to
wipe his shining face! The hair clung to his damp
forehead as he slipped off his helmet and dropped
it with a little clang of the chain, on to the table in
the hall. Mrs. Lewin was in the further room, Abdallah
said—oh, yes, she was at home to visitors.
Brissy tried instinctively to muffle his spurs as he
walked across the bare boards, through the hanging
curtains, and into her white presence.</p>

<p>She was sitting by the window, looking out
through an open door to the hot riot of the hillside,
where the wind sang in the grasses and came back
laden with sweetness from the flowering trees, but
she turned her head sharply at the sound of his
ringing step (why did those spurs jar so?) and rose
and met him. The instant he got close to her he
saw that she knew, though how he did not stop to
puzzle out, and with the tears running down his
scorched face he took her hands in his and tried to
speak.</p>

<p>“This is kind of you, Brissy,” she said in a quick,
low voice, looking up into the eyes she had called
soulless. The first thing she had realised was that
he had made the simple self-sacrifice from which
other men had flinched, and come to tell her as he
best could, with less self-consciousness than they,
but suffering far more from a personal feeling. Another
of her theories fell from her while he stood
there holding her hands, and with a bewildered humiliation
she felt that she would never judge any
one again. For this man of all the Station she had
always held a little in contempt.</p>

<p>“I had a letter by the mail,” she said, quite quietly
and collectedly, but as if a little weary. “He
sent it by a runner, just before—he.... And
the man got through in time to deliver it and catch
the mail—almost before any one knew. Mustn’t it
have been a wonderful journey? All down through
the German territory, and by Lake Nyassa into
Rhodesia, I suppose. But he was a Malagasy—Ally’s
own servant, Longa—and they are marvellous
runners. You know Longa means <i>friend</i> in the
vernacular—strange, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>She paused, as if she were thinking, and put her
hand up to her hair as if a little uncertain that it lay
in its usual correct masses. He only said brokenly,
“Poor old Ally!—he backed out,”—that seemed to
trouble Brissy!—“I wish I had been there.”</p>

<p>“You would never have done it,”—she shook her
head with a flash of intuition. “You were stronger
than he.” She thought a moment, and then went
on in the same curious fashion. “Yes, Longa (and
that means a friend!) brought the letter to Capetown,
and sent it on to me by the mail. Here it is—oh
yes! do look at it!”</p>

<p>She nearly thrust it into his hands, which trembled
as they held it. He almost felt that he ought
not to look, as his blurred eyes travelled over the
blotted sheets.</p>

<p>Poor Ally! Poor, handsome, unreliable Ally—proved
incompetent, and such a failure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>It was a disconnected letter at best, and nothing
really but a confession of the man’s shame, which
had to be pieced together from a knowledge of
him, for he had made no coherent statement. He
had fallen in with his own regiment, who were
camped just outside Port Cecil, and what with the
reaction in getting out of Key Island, and “the fellows”
being glad to welcome him—well, the result
was the same as it had been when he failed before, and
the Administrator wanted him on the night of the
threatened rising. He did not remember very much.
He was not dead drunk this time—if he had been it
might have saved him—but after dining with the
regiment (and God knows what he had said to them,
only they were decent fellows and would shield him),
he had had an important interview with the
men most involved in the insurrection. It was a
private interview, and a diplomatic affair that was to
be kept very dark. Melton Hanney arranged it, he
had been most decent all through—there was no
blame attached to him. He had settled with Ally
as to when the meeting should take place, but had
not been present at the interview. There was an
argument—Ally did not remember the details very
well—only his head was heated, and he got impatient,
and lost his temper and threatened. The men
saw his condition and drew him on—then he
bragged of his Government, and their powers; and
then—then—all that Gregory had explained to him
so carefully lest he should make mistakes, was
blurted out, and the very nation perhaps involved
by his folly. He knew what he had done almost
before they left him with smooth, guarded speeches,
though no hint of animosity, and a kind of sullen
despair settled down on him. That was three days
ago, before his letter was written—three days of
agonising suspense, and time to think over what he
had done. Nothing was known as yet; he was
supposed to be communicating with his chiefs, or
forming an ultimatum. In the meantime he had
arranged for a shooting excursion inland—and there
was more truth in it than would appear! It seemed
the only thing to do—but he must write the truth
to Hanney. It was not Hanney’s fault, and it
might leave him a chance to do something, and
avert disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“He is a thoroughly capable man, and knows the
whole situation—in my opinion, if that goes for anything
now, he ought to have managed it from the
first,” wrote Alaric Lewin a few hours before death.
“Why did they send me? You said I could not do
it—you were right as usual. I’m no good, Chum—you
always wanted me to do something, but you
would never have made me. I’m better out of it—it’s
the least I can do, for I should only disgrace
you if I lived. You don’t know what I’ve done this
time—it was a big thing, bigger than you all imagine,
and I’ve hashed it. I only trust I shan’t get
Gregory into the mess with me. It is not his fault
any more than Hanney’s. The Home Government
ought to leave it to the man on the spot, or be sure
who they send. And there have been worse things
in my life that concern you, that I can’t tell you
either. They involve others. Only forgive us, and
believe that I’m doing the best thing possible for
you now. Good-bye, Chum—and God bless you!”</p>

<p>It was signed with his full name, but the letters
were more scrawled than usual, and the whole letter
was blotted and uncertain. The suspicion that hurt
Brissy more than all was what the trembling handwriting
betrayed—the man had been so afraid of
the thing he was going to do! He had not wanted
to die. Only his desperation and the stress of circumstances
in which he found himself had driven
him to a last bold action—forced him, morally at
least, to go down with his back against the wall.</p>

<p>For the idea of cowardice had faded out of Captain
Nugent’s mind. He saw from that piteous,
confused letter of the man who had hardly understood
his own disaster, that what might have been
weakness in himself was a kind of furious bravery in
Ally. With an unusual stretch of imagination, he
fancied the beautiful set face, the splendidly-built
figure in the lonely place in which his friend had
chosen to die, and heard the crash of the revolver.
Curiously enough he knew Ally’s revolvers; they
were a pair he had given him himself. That they
should come to such a use as this!</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin had been standing beside him patiently
while he read the letter. She made no comment,
and asked no question as he handed back
the sheets, but with a curious new speculation in
her face she turned upon him suddenly.</p>

<p>“They know—at Government House?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, there was a cable, and a letter followed by
the mail from Beira.”</p>

<p>“When did the cable come?”</p>

<p>Brissy hesitated. “This morning, I suppose. I
did not hear.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” she said quietly. “It came
last night.”</p>

<p>The conviction was so strong in her mind that it
seemed to revolutionise her thoughts. Gregory had
certainly known last night, it accounted for his disturbed
manner and his sudden appearance. But
why had he not prepared her at least? Why had
he thought that when she knew it would prove a
barrier between them—unless he had expected this
beforehand, calculated upon it, plotted some such
solution of the problem that had threatened to keep
them apart! The dreadful suspicion was so intolerable
that she began to fancy she was going mad.
She could not think consecutively—she could not
reason, or judge with mercy. She seemed to have
lost her power to be charitable, and almost to think
of him as a deliberate murderer. For the time all
other feeling was dead in her, stunned with the
shock, and her one dread was that she might have
to see him or speak to him. Her last night’s self
seemed as far removed from herself of to-day as
though they were two separate beings. She could
not remember even her love for him; there seemed
only the dull pain of it left.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Gilderoy came in later to see her, she
found her lying on her own bed in a kind of stupour;
yet the instant she spoke to her Leoline’s
brain responded, and she answered with perfect
coherence—it was only her feeling that was numb.
She had even settled her plans too, and knew what
she meant to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot leave in this mail boat. I must wait
to see if there are more details to be got, and to arrange
things also. There is business to settle here
that could not be done by to-morrow, and much to
go into.”</p>

<p>“What will you do then? You will not remain
here?”</p>

<p>“I shall go to Vohitra as soon as I have packed
up our things and left this house ready for—for the
next people. I want you to stay here with me for
the few days if you will.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you to Vohitra too, if my good man
can spare me. Or if I can’t actually start with you
(of course you’ll want to get away as soon as ever
you can) I’ll follow you.”</p>

<p>“I shall stay here until the next mail,” said Leoline
levelly. “I have no black clothes of course—is
there a sewing woman in the town who could
make me something?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a very decent little woman too for such a
place. I will see about that for you. You won’t
go out, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“She can come up to you. Oh, I am the bearer
of a message from Mr. Gregory himself. His sincere——”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” said Leoline sharply. For a moment
her calm seemed broken through. She put her
hands over her horror-stricken eyes as if she saw
something that Mrs. Gilderoy could not see. “The
Administrator was the man who appointed Captain
Lewin to East Africa,” she continued in a low voice.
“You can understand how I feel. Of course it is
unreasonable.”</p>

<p>“But natural at the moment. I quite understand.
Under the circumstances you would rather
not see him?”</p>

<p>“He has not asked to see me, surely!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“No, but a visit of condolence is almost inevitable.
I will see that he does not come. If he
wants to express his sympathy he can lend you his
yacht to take you round to Port Albert. That is a
much more practical and sensible thing to do.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Lewin did not answer. She lay with
closed eyes, not bearing, but enduring, until thought
was kind to her, and instead of the nightmare of
her new suspicions, or the recollection of that
blotted letter, she remembered the revelation of
Bristow Nugent—poor Brissy, who had come to her
with the tears running down his face, and whom she
had always good-humouredly despised as too
coarsely moulded for fine feeling. Truly, our God
creates strange and hidden beauties in the vessels
which He makes of clay. And who shall know His
mind as to which were fashioned to honour and
which to dishonour?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two days later the mail went out, and carried
Alfred Halton through the Gates, out of prison back
to England. Half Port Victoria, still talking of
“poor Lewin’s death,” came down to the wharf to
see him off, and the Administrator came also.
Hardly a word had passed between the two men on
the subject in everybody’s mouth beyond what was
necessary, but before they said good-bye Halton
expressed an official regret over the gravity of the
situation in Port Cecil, and his eyes, meeting Gregory’s,
declared war.</p>

<p>“I have already stated my opinion that Lewin
was the wrong man to send,” he said quietly, “I
can only wish you well out of the unfortunate complication!”
The small man was turning to bay at
last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“The Colonial Office will not hold you responsible,
at any rate,” said Gregory with his insolent
lidless stare. “My course of action was entirely
my own.”</p>

<p>“And any disaster that followed.”</p>

<p>“Melton Hanney is at Port Cecil,” said Gregory
with a shrug of his shoulders. “If one cannot
trust the man in place one may as well throw up the
sponge. I do not suppose that Lewin’s indiscretions
will lead to international trouble, but if they did—it
means a certain expenditure of men and money,”
he ended composedly.</p>

<p>Halton turned his face slowly to the man who
was his better by just the larger qualities that made
him without fear, and it was ugly to see. As the
Administrator put his foot on the gang-plank to
leave the ship, his fellow in office spoke softly,
barbed words that were intended for, and reached
no other ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“‘Some of the King’s servants be dead,’” he
quoted slowly, “‘and thy servant Uriah the Hittite
is dead also!’” It was the last that passed between
them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin had not seen Diana Churton, save at
passing moments, for a period of some weeks, but
she encountered her on the day she started for
Vohitra. Diana had called in company with other
women in the Station, during the time following
Ally’s departure; but Leoline had always looked
upon her as her husband’s friend, and did not expect,
or desire, an equal attention to herself.
Diana’s scanty visits had not impressed her in any
way, and her own absorption during those drifting,
golden weeks blinded her usual observation. It
struck her with a positive shock that Mrs. Churton
had aged when she came face to face with her in
the morning sunlight on the quay; but the knowledge
even then lay dormant in her mind, not to be
considered upon until some day she might have
need of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>The Administrator had placed his yacht at her
disposal, and she made use of it in preference to
the coasting steamer, which otherwise was the only
means of transport to Port Albert. The yacht was
a fussy, old-fashioned little steamboat in itself, prone
to kick in the deep current that washed the east
coast of the island; but at least she did not smell
of oil, and she had passenger accommodation, while
the coasting steamers had none save the dirty deck,
which was crowded with fruit and coloured people
in about equal proportions. Mrs. Lewin accepted
the hospitality of the <i>Hova</i>, and found herself the
only passenger.</p>

<p>Liscarton came also, to his deep disgust and the
degradation of his dignity. He had been Captain
Nugent’s last gift to Leoline, who accepted him
with a faint smile at the remembrance of Mrs.
Gilderoy’s comments on the significance of a pony
in Key’land. Brissy left by the mail that also took
Halton out of the Rat-trap. He came up to the
bungalow to say good-bye, and sat looking desperate
for twenty minutes, while Mrs. Lewin unconsciously
made him more unhappy by loving him
across the room with her speaking eyes. He had
so often bored her by lingering at her tea-table that
she felt her reluctance to let him go on this occasion
a judgment upon her, and was always a little
ashamed in her after life to remember that she had
very nearly kissed him. Fortunately for his peace
of mind, Captain Bristow Nugent thought his
chance of heaven no more remote than such a
privilege.</p>

<p>It was in turning round to watch Liscarton’s
vagaries in embarking that Leoline Lewin saw another
pony being led off by a groom, and a dust-coloured
habit that she knew advancing on her.
Beneath the white helmet Diana’s face seemed to
have fallen in and grown pinched; her hard-burnt
colour had faded somewhat, and her eyes were the
eyes of an uncertain beast—some wild thing in
captivity that awaits a chance to bite its keeper
through all its habit of obedience. Her loud voice
was alone unchanged. It greeted Mrs. Lewin with
the same bluff comradeship she adopted in her
feminine friendships.</p>

<p>“So you’re off to Vohitra! Best thing you could
do. I wish I could get up there too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“I hoped you might come up later, perhaps,”
said Mrs. Lewin as they shook hands. It struck
her as hopelessly indecent that she should stand
here on the quay chatting after Key’land fashion,
when she had only had news of her husband’s death
about a week since. But the conventionalities of
tradition seemed squeezed out by the narrow limits
of life in the tiny Station. For a day or so she
might shut herself out from public view behind
drawn shutters, but the instant she appeared in the
open air an encounter was unavoidable; and why
should she turn her back upon friends because her
husband was dead? she thought blankly. After
all, life had to go on. She was dully surprised to
find herself talking much the same as usual, of the
narrow round of intimacy, of the people she knew,
of monotonous, local interests. “Mrs. Gilderoy
joins me on Thursday,” she found herself saying,
as if it were an ordinary summer outing. “Won’t
you come too?”</p>

<p>“Can’t, unfortunately. Bute came back this
week.”</p>

<p>“He has been for quite a long shoot, hasn’t he?
Ah, he rode round the island—I forgot.” Again
Mrs. Gilderoy occurred to her mind, and a dull
speculation crossed it as to whether she were right,
and Diana’s face bore testimony to a domestic
tragedy.</p>

<p>“Yes, he wanted a change,” Mrs. Churton said
naturally, and in so composed a manner it dispelled
the idea of anything being wrong. “He was
awfully seedy before he went. This place doesn’t
suit him. But it doesn’t suit any one long. How
are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Leoline simply. “What
does it matter? One just goes on living. Tell me
the news of the place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“There is none. The Clayton woman has taken
a religious craze, Rennie tells me. He can’t stand
her any longer, so he’ll probably revert to Trixie
Denver. There’s nothing else to amuse him until
he gets transferred. You go home next mail, I
suppose? How I envy you!” She drew a long
rasping breath that seemed to hurt her.</p>

<p>“I would have been contented to stop here if I
could have kept as I was,” said Mrs. Lewin bitterly,
for the shock that her life had sustained had driven
her back on a former mental attitude. She felt at
the moment that if she could wipe out the horror
of her suspicion about Gregory, she would be content
to live out her life with Alaric Lewin and all
his weakness and failure. She glanced down at her
long slim figure in its new black, and Mrs. Churton’s
eyes followed her own.</p>

<p>“Mourning is awfully hot,” she said simply.
“You can wear white if you like at Vohitra—there
will be no one to see. I don’t see that it matters—when
one feels much, clothes seem so insignificant
a proof, don’t they?” Her sharpened face took a
strained hurt look that made it pathetic.</p>

<p>“Oh, what do I care!” said Chum, impatient of
her own pain and remorse, missing all hint of the
other’s. “One cannot lose one’s instincts of course,
but I would wear sackcloth—with a cut,” she added
honestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>They parted there on the quay, unconscious of
the bitterness in each other’s hearts, Diana to go
back to the house that held a grim tragedy for her
in her husband’s face—Leoline to take ship and flee
from herself, if such a miracle had been permitted.
She could not get away, any more than Bute
Churton and his wife could get away from the
degradation of that every-day life in which he had
always a memory to shame him, she one that had
driven the iron into her soul. She had never given
him a chance to ask her pardon. It was the one
revenge left her, for she knew that he could not rest
in the sense of his own lost self-esteem. He was
trying to speak of it, and she would not let him.
Sometimes she watched the big man moving about
uneasily, with hard brown eyes that hated him, and
knew that his mind was troubled, until she would
have liked to have mocked him. She grew cruel in
those days, for the grinding intimacy of their narrow
life prevented either of them gaining a long
enough respite to think, and learn patience apart.
Truly Key Island was a trap!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>It looked so in reality to Mrs. Lewin from the
deck of the yacht, as she was carried out of harbour.
Once more her eyes rested on the green
circle of Maitso and Mitsinjovy cuddling the bay.
She looked back at the little palm-ridden place,
and the ravenalas lifted solemn hands in blessing
on the shore even as she passed through the gates
and out to the open channel. For a minute Leoline
breathed more freely as the heat of the harbour
was replaced by a warm sea wind, but she had not
got rid of Key Island even yet. The yacht hugged
the coast, and the lovely shore was flashed on her
line of vision as she lay in her deck-chair and looked
idly at her surroundings. Maitso Hill faded round a
point, and the deep water enabled them to pass
closely to the warm green slopes that seemed to
hang right down over the water. Some way inland,
among the desolate native villages of the Company’s
day, a brotherhood of priests had settled themselves,
with the fervour of their Order for conversion of
the hopelessly intermingled black races. The Domicile
was not visible from the coast, but with a very
lovely expression of their religion they had set up
here and there a white cross in the dense green
vegetation. They did not mark either grave or
shrine—they were simply placed there for the love
of the symbol, and the sudden pure white thing uplifting
its pathetic memory against the riotous growth
of the cliff, brought the relief of unhoped-for tears
to Leoline’s eyes. There seemed something infinitely
gracious in this memory of God set up for
chance passers-by—a gleaming, plain white cross,
standing out in strong relief against the wild green,
clinging as it were to the very edge of the land,
above the sea. For so the priests of Notre Seigneur
have set them up on the East coast of Key Island,
like a beacon.</p>

<p>By and by the yacht passed a point of land where
the Captain pointed out an old battered gun, still
thrusting up a helpless muzzle through the guava
and logwood which had triumphantly woven it a
grave. He gave Mrs. Lewin a telescope to make it
out, and she wished she had not looked—its futile
mouth, agape through the green, seemed like a discarded
servant whom man had ungratefully forgotten
and left to rot among the forces of Nature.</p>

<p>“In the time of the Company they fortified all
this coast, because of the French cruisers,” said the
Captain, in explanation. “You will find all the
Madagascan side of the island ready to fight—but
we expect peace from our African neighbours.”</p>

<p>“Besides, the sand-banks are a safeguard against
any enemy,” said Mrs. Lewin dryly. “And Africa
Point is hardly the kind of coast on which to effect
a landing! What is the name of this Point where
the poor old gun stands?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“Tifiro—it means, briefly, shoot! Not that they
could have done much execution with that old
thing. It’s about as much use as the guns that the
Government give to our Volunteers at home! The
Company themselves removed their fortifications to
Port Albert during the last few years of their reign
in Key Island, and since it became a Government
affair they have been added to and improved.”</p>

<p>Another long luxuriance of coast brought them
into harbour again; but the little town of Port Albert
looked a mere village after the important coaling-station
of Port Victoria, and the vaunted fortifications
seemed in a very unfinished condition. There
was a landing-jetty, but more for the convenience of
shipping the sugar than for the accommodation of
passengers or general cargo. It looked like a native
settlement at first sight, all the huts raised on their
four little feet above the ground, and the cluster of
thatched roofs suggesting China Town over again.
As it happened, Leoline had never been to Port
Albert before, and had imagined it a much larger
place. She stood forlornly among her baggage as
it was placed on the jetty, the servants who had accompanied
her huddling round with the thrust-out
lower lip of native disapproval.</p>

<p>The Administrator’s yacht had attracted some
attention, and a staring group of coloured people
were pushed aside by a tall burnt man in the universal
riding-breeches and linen coat, who came
forward and lifted a broad hat to Mrs. Lewin.</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Ambroise, the Town Warden,” he explained
in the pleasant free manner that men gain
in such small corners of the Empire, where they feel
their nation all one big family. “Mr. Gregory sent
me word that a lady would put up at my house for
a night on the way up to Vohitra. Are you Mrs.
Lewin?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I don’t like to trouble you to turn out!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right. I always go to the hotel
when any one comes up, and leave them my place.
Mosquitoes don’t hurt me for the night, you see,
and the hotel is—well, rather impossible for ladies!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“I know, I’ve tried the Natale!”</p>

<p>“At Port Victoria? It’s a palace compared to
this, I assure you!” He laughed his pleasant, unrestrained
laugh, as if his lungs had never been
cramped. Then, glancing at her black gown, the
eyes under the broad hat grew graver and a little
pitiful. Mrs. Lewin looked unintentionally girlish
and appealing in the simplicity of the clothes which
were all that the native dressmaker could accomplish.
But because she was herself it seemed bound
to fit her, and the beauty of her figure was quite as
obvious under their plain folds as in her more elaborate
gowns. Mr. Ambroise thought with honest
sympathy of the poor fellow who had made such a
hash of things in East Africa, and looked into Mrs.
Lewin’s eyes with a little sense of awe. Like every
one else, he could never tell their exact colour; he
only knew that they were most wonderful, and held
a tragedy.</p>

<p>“Is this all your baggage—and your servants?”
he said, looking round him at her property, which
seemed to her rather overwhelming on the elementary
jetty. “Everything you have?”</p>

<p>“Except my pony. They are disembarking him
now—with some difficulty,” said Leoline drily.</p>

<p>Liscarton had a character of his own, and was
showing it. He might have been a member of
Parliament in some former state of existence from
his tendency to argue. When he had done his best
to demolish the jetty with his hoofs, and had scattered
the crowd to the safety of the beach, he consented
to walk quietly into the little town, his ears
laid back among his ragged mane, and the whites of
his eyes showing wickedly.</p>

<p>“I have no cart, and it is only half-a-mile—will
you walk?” said Ambroise simply. “You won’t
get on that brute, will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“I think he would behave better if I rode him,”
said Mrs. Lewin. “It does not matter about a
habit—I can ride in this skirt.”</p>

<p>It seemed to her a strange procession through
the dirty little streets—herself mounted, by gracious
permission of Liscarton, Ambroise walking at the
pony’s shoulder, the servants behind, and half-a-dozen
natives following with the boxes. The men
here she noticed, with the knowledge gained in six
months, were more Malagasy than Negro—a much
finer race, brown-skinned and blue-eyed, with flattened
slender limbs, and features which had the
pensive dignity of the Hindoo. Ambroise’s servants
were of the same tribe, from Anossi, and
waited on her that night with strange words that
she did not recognise, even from the Patois—<i>Inona
izao?</i> for What do you wish? and <i>Salama</i> for
greeting. The night was intensely hot—far hotter
than any she had spent in the bungalow—and she
was not sorry to rise at four next morning to ride
out to Vohitra. At all events it was in the hills,
and would be cooler than this low-lying, crowded
little town.</p>

<p>“I sent up some supplies,” Ambroise said, as he
marshalled the little procession, and mounted his
own pony—he was going to ride out with them
some way, and show them the road—“and my butler
is up there waiting for you. I hope you’ll find
everything in order. I have sent plenty of tinned
things, as it’s difficult to get them out sometimes,
and you might run short.”</p>

<p>“It is most kind of you to take all this trouble.
Mrs. Gilderoy did not warn me that I should be so
helpless on other people’s bounty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“She took it all for granted, most likely. They
always stay with me when they go out to Vohitra,
and I send up and open the place for them beforehand.”</p>

<p>“You know the Gilderoys?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. She’s a clever woman. He’s rather
too caustic for my taste. It’s like an overdose of
quinine to talk to him for long!”</p>

<p>“Do you often have visitors?”</p>

<p>“Only during the summer as a rule. But it’s
always summer, more or less, isn’t it? The temperature
does not alter much. My most frequent
guest is Mr. Gregory. He is round about once a
fortnight, and since he has been Administrator the
accommodation has had to be looked to, owing to
his fashion of visiting every part of his little domain
at a minute’s notice. Not that he would mind if
one gave him a Karross and the bare ground; but
his unexpected appearances have had a salutary
effect on the police stations, at which one generally
has to stay in a native village.”</p>

<p>Leoline was silent, while a sudden fear gripped
her heart. Even here she was not safe from him, it
seemed. She had come away from Port Victoria
with some idea of leaving it all behind her—the
horror and the pain; she had forgotten his constant
visits to Port Albert as well as China Town,
and the native settlements on the Tableland.
She felt the confinement of the island again,
which, for a time, she had lost in the distraction
of seeing its further extent. It was no less a trap
because the rats ran round it in their desire to
escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>After a time they left Port Albert behind them,
and were out in the Tsara Valley—the great centre
of the sugar-growing industry in Key Island. They
were leaving the river, and crossing the wide fields
to their right, the ponies going single file to keep
the narrow paths which were all the greedy Planters
allowed through their rich plantations, save the lines
of rail for the trucks. As the valley opened before
them, Leoline felt blinded by the cane. It spread
on all sides, a sheet of liquid sunshine, from the bed
of the Volofatsy River, which cut it in two, up even
to the hillsides, clear gold-green, waving with every
breath of wind that crossed it, a sight to see once
and remember always. The valley was clothed
with it, and the dark sides of the mountains, that
shot up out of its reach, seemed only to throw it
into greater prominence.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine crop,” Ambroise said, drawing rein
and looking round him. “And nearly ripe. You’ll
see the sugar industry in its glory, Mrs. Lewin.
They will begin cutting next week.”</p>

<p>“Where is the factory?”</p>

<p>“Behind us, but the other side of the river. I
must say good-bye to you here. There’s your road,
that track up the mountain side. Good-bye!
Please send out to me if you want anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>He rode off in the increasing day, and Leoline
went on her lonely way, the coloured people closing
in behind her. She could not miss her road for
there was but one, though it wound in and out what
looked like unbroken forest from the valley. High
up on the hillside hung Vohitra, a long building
with the inevitable stoep and an old tiled roof. It
looked nothing but a toy thing, like a Swiss châlet,
against the massed woods of the mountain crest, but
below it in the hollow the vegetation was less
severe. There was a grove of bananas tossed down
the very slope where the house rested, and below
this again the plaintive tone of bamboo—not the
insistent liquid sunshine of the cane that filled the
valley, but the hesitating green that is pale and
golden and infinitely soft by reason of the feathery
mass of its foliage. Down the heart of the valley
came the river, a shallow stream that sang loudly to
the silent listening heavens and the kites, for there
seemed no one else to hear. Even Vohitra, with its
hint of humanity, was infinitely lonely.</p>

<p>Breakfast was laid for her on the stoep, and Ambroise’s
butler, a tall comely Malagasy, bowed low
before her with the murmured “Salama!” and asked
her pleasure before he left the hill and returned to
Port Albert. She looked at his picturesque figure
in its deeply fringed <i>lamba</i>—the Malagasy at Port
Victoria had in general discarded the native dress—and
wished that she might have kept him in preference
to Hafez, already grumbling among the calabashes.
But she had no orders to give, save a pathetic
request for a bath, and that, she learned,
already awaited her.</p>

<p>She ate her breakfast in sight of the cane, which
was beginning to assert its old influence upon her.
There are two crops in Key Island; the one she had
seen cut and crushed in Mr. Denver’s factory was
the lesser yield, but the Tsara Valley was now in its
full glory. Her eyes strayed down the hillside to
the rich harvest in the valley again and again, with
a kind of fascination. It soothed her in some
strange fashion to see the clear colour that always
suggested spring and new life, and hope, even
though the season was really autumn. Tsara—spring
o’ the year! The very name seemed to
breathe the pure green of ripened sap, the rejuvenescence
of Nature. The shock and jar of sudden
death had come so near her of late, that she felt as
if it had dinned her senses; now it hummed off into
distance again, and life closed peacefully round her,
leaving her time to think....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>She sauntered through the house after a while,
and looked at the long rows of closed doors, for the
bungalow was a large one and built to accommodate
many visitors, being in a sense a government hotel
for the use of sorely-tried officials. The rooms
were like loose boxes, and not much larger, but the
heat was far less oppressive than in the lower portions
of the island, and when the doors were fastened
back the cool breeze that blew straight through
the house, down the long corridor, made them bearable
even at night. Mrs. Lewin’s room was exactly
like all the others, save that it possessed a key, which
she had sternly demanded of Ambroise’s butler.
None of the other doors appeared to have any fastening
beyond a rickety handle.</p>

<p>From the house itself she found the stable, and
Liscarton, who received her with distrust as one
who had lured him into the wilderness. Nor would
he accept the sugar she offered, which for a pony
who was always hungry was a proof of great offence.
But sometimes he would sulk for days if his
temper were upset. She pulled his head down in
spite of his resentful manner, and kissed the white
blaze between his wild eyes and the rough fringe on
his forehead. Neither his mane nor tail had been
cut, for he had never played polo, and it gave him
an untamed appearance in contrast to other ponies.
Mrs. Lewin hid the sugar in his manger in case he
should change his mind, and went in search of the
bath-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>She discovered it at the end of a steep path which
took her a hundred yards down the hillside. It was
nothing but a rough wooden shed, with a zinc roof
that did not touch the further wall by some inches.
As Mrs. Lewin undressed she looked up and saw a
slit of azure sky and the crowned head of a cocoanut
palm that kept watch above her, but the palm
had no appreciative eyes for a new version of Eve.
The floor was just warm mother earth, for it had
neither been flagged nor matted, and the bath itself
was a deep zinc tub with a foot of dubious water in
it. Leoline balanced daintily on the piece of board
which was all the carpeting allowed to save her from
the gritty ground, and observed that the other furniture
of the place consisted of an old cigarette-tin
nailed to the wall for a soap dish, and a wooden peg
on which the towels hung. It was not luxurious,
but any means of washing is respected in Key Island,
and she had learned humility in this respect.
By the time she sauntered back to the bungalow it
was nine o’clock, and the broad heat had begun.</p>

<p>One day was very like another at Vohitra; it
seemed as if the hours had melted into each other,
and the solitude and rest were healing her nature
from the wrench it had sustained. She could think
now, and face her own evolution. She did not read
much, though she had brought a box of books with
her. Curiously enough, it was none of these, but a
little broken-backed <i>Rubaiyat</i> that she found on a
dusty shelf at Vohitra that was her closest companion
when she desired a book at all. It had probably
been left behind by a former visitor, and it opened
so invariably at one stanza that she never seemed to
get any further—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some for the riches of the world, and some</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ah, take the cash, and let the credit go!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor heed the rolling of a distant drum.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The volume used to lie open in her lap at this
verse, while she looked so long at the cane, and
thought of Gregory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>She could bear to think of him now, even though
with a consciousness of her own responsibility she
recognised that her intuitive fear had not been one
to argue away—he had foreseen and looked for
some such removing of the barrier between them,
as had actually occurred. If she could, she would
have screened him with the impression she had first
had of his motive in appointing Alaric to the difficulty
and danger of East Africa; she had thought
that his words had a literal meaning when he said
that he could not part from her, and that he had
sent her husband away to indulge the momentary
impulse, perhaps even to come to an understanding
between them, and woo and win her. Anyhow, she
had looked at it as an indefinite move, a respite from
Ally’s presence—no more. That would have been
a woman’s way—her own way, perhaps, but not Gregory’s.
The strong man looked further ahead, he
had no motiveless actions. There was a darker object
in Captain Lewin’s appointment than a mere
desire to be rid of him at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>She seemed to have discovered this without effort
on her part, as soon as she realised that he had
known of Alaric’s death the night before it was
made public. He had been afraid of losing her—his
own consciousness told him that he might, if she
knew. Had he been innocent of this blood, the
fear would not have struck him at all. She never
masked the situation to herself any more, once she
had faced it; this man that she loved had no scruples,
he struck at what stood in his path, though it
might be human life, and his career was a proof of
such fearless murder. Well, the kings of the earth
have succeeded so. But the marvel to her was that
this knowledge of him had not killed her love. It
had been numbed with the blow of her discovery
of his pitfall for the man who stood in his way;
but as the first horror passed off, as the mental life
flowed back to her in the solitude of Vohitra, she
realised that her heart had only been paralysed—the
pain of returning feeling proved it alive through its
very wounds. The last of her theories fell before
the very anguish that cried out for him, the yearning
of all her womanhood to his master touch. She
had thought that she could not love save at a certain
standard; Evelyn Gregory could only reach that
standard in one particular, that of ruthless strength,
but the knowledge of his shortcomings, though it
might appal her, did not make him one whit less
dear to her.</p>

<p>The very pain of it seemed to have developed her
into something alien, a character not her own. She
had been so sure she knew herself, that the revelation
of that in her which could overthrow her theories
made her more patient and anxious to learn
of her own fundamental nature. It was a new education,
for she proved what is true of women in all
ages—that love teaches them a sorrow so deep that
they hide it in their secret consciousness, and swear
they are happy. They never are happy, from the
days of Eve and Adam until now; yet the woman
does not exist, and never did exist, who, having been
in love, would part with the experience. She would
often willingly part with her after-memory of the
man, and her disillusion; but with her own private
emotions, and the glow and glory of which he was
only the trivial cause, she would not part if God
tried the experiment of offering her a miracle and
showed her her past undone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>The few days of solitude before Mrs. Gilderoy
joined her were invaluable to Leoline Lewin, for
they gave her some sort of a real insight into herself.
By the time Mrs. Gilderoy climbed the hill on
her pony, bringing a breath of the stale life of Port
Victoria with her, Mrs. Lewin could listen and pay
a courteous attention without moral dislocation.
Mrs. Gilderoy was both kind and shrewd; but the
habit of many years will not be held in check by
dormant good qualities, and she had used her quick
wits on the social world around her until a smart
saying became her second nature. It was irresistible
to her to score off people, however much she
might like them, and sometimes the talent even surprised
her into a lie.</p>

<p>“Is Major Churton back yet?” Leoline asked, as
they sat at their first dinner together. “I saw Diana
the day I left. She told me he was coming.”</p>

<p>“He looks a good deal browner and older. I
encountered him at the Denvers’, lifting Trixie in and
out of the hammock which she hangs up with that
end in view. Some man has always got her in his
arms. She likes them to paw her! Bute Churton
goes there far too much.”</p>

<p>“Di told me that Mrs. Clayton had taken to religion—has
Miss Denver tasted conversion also?”</p>

<p>“No, but it’s true about Eva Clayton. She talks
about God as if He were an intimate acquaintance
whose views she could always command on the telephone.
And of course they always coincide with
her own conduct! Wray wants to ask her if the
Deity approves of ladies smoking! He hates her
cigarettes, does my good man.”</p>

<p>“God has come into fashion,” said Mrs. Lewin
rather bitterly. “At one time we kept our knowledge
of Him to ourselves, as if ashamed of it, except
in church, but now it is quite <i>chic</i> to drag Him
into daily life. One almost gives His name as a reference—with
one’s banker’s!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and so even the name has become cheapened.”</p>

<p>“It is inconsistent of me perhaps,” Mrs. Lewin
confessed, “but I would rather hear a man use it as
an oath and blaspheme that Name, than a woman
turn it to account and use it for effect, even though
half unconsciously.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>“It is after all the worse blasphemy—and so
common now-a-days. Sentimental people always
fall back upon God as an excuse for their own self-indulgence.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin thought of the one sin that shall not
be forgiven—the sin against the Holy Ghost, which
is the sin of the spirit and worse than the sin of the
letter. But she did not say so, being possessed of
the grace of silence.</p>

<p>“The result of Eva’s hypocrisy, however, has not
been exactly satisfactory, from her point of view,”
laughed Mrs. Gilderoy. “The Rennie boy has defected,
and now wanders about looking for a new
pitfall. He wants to come out and see us, by the
way. Is it too soon? Would you mind?”</p>

<p>“I do not mind,” said Mrs. Lewin slowly, “in the
sense of its being too soon after my husband’s death.
There is no real sooner or later in these things—it
is merely a decent custom of civilisation which
makes us pull down the blinds, and pretend to the
world that we are weeping. Every one knows in
their own minds that one cannot weep for more than
a few hours at most. Why should I mind seeing visitors?
Particularly in such a community as this!
But I wish, if any one must come out, that it had
been Mr. Gurney. Simply because I should like to
hear him sing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is always a voice with a man tacked on.
Unfortunately he can’t realise it though,” said Mrs.
Gilderoy drily. “If you asked him to come he
would tell the whole Station. I think the Rennie
boy is really safer, Chum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lewin assented absently, and Mr. Rennie
arrived in due course, and became an unconscious
factor in spinning the web of her fate. She had
made an effort in raising no objection to his presence,
partly on Mrs. Gilderoy’s account, for though
that lady was good-natured enough to come out to
Vohitra without the stimulant of a larger party, it
must, as Leoline knew, be both dull and monotonous
to her. The reward of her virtue was a new
revelation in the diagnosis she was making of her
own self, and the touchstone nothing but the light
words of a boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Rennie stayed some days at Vohitra, sitting
figuratively and sometimes literally at the feet of
both ladies. He was shy of grief, and at first looked
with distrust at Leoline’s black-gowned figure.
But her composed manner reassured while it puzzled
him. The women with whom he had been
best acquainted had been of a type that hysterically
wails its sorrows in the market-place, and is consolable
the week after. But Mrs. Lewin was even
capable of smiling at a small joke, though the
flowerful softness of her face had a new gravity that
seemed to have touched it with a shadow. Chum’s
eyebrows were always a little suggestive of tragedy,
from a curve belied by her smiling eyes; but Rennie
saw, vaguely, that the face he admired had
gained something—a greater womanhood perhaps,
almost the strength of maternity. Not having the
key he put it down to Alaric Lewin’s sudden death,
but he did not think that she would be easily consoled.
Lewin, poor fellow, had been of a type which
Rennie could conscientiously admire. His good
looks, coupled with a certain air of breeding about
him, made him a model for younger men; and to
play polo and tennis as Ally did by nature was attainment
enough for military ambition. Ally, as a
married man, almost made bachelorhood look puny,
for the tie had never interfered with his attractiveness
to the opposite sex. Rennie would have been
a married man on such terms. No wonder that
Mrs. Lewin’s grief for this hero went deeper than a
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>He was sitting on a stool—but not of repentance—at
her feet, on the evening before his departure.
The stoep was their usual sitting-room, and they
had gathered there after dinner for desultory chat,
Mrs. Gilderoy swinging her small compact body in
the paintless remains of a rocking-chair, Mrs. Lewin
leaning back against as many cushions as Rennie
could find for her basket-work lounge, Rennie himself
with his back to one of the pillars of the stoep,
and his hands clasped round his knees. He had ridden
down into the valley that afternoon with Mrs.
Lewin to see the sugar factory, and while becoming a
little heady with the changing colours of her eyes, he
did not know that the smell of the rich sugar brought
back the day she went over Denver’s, and that a
ghost walked by her in his place and pointed out all
the transformations of the cane to her, from the
crushing and ejection of the waste for fuel, to the
last refinement and glittering heaps waiting to be
bagged. The dark, luscious-smelling place was a
dream of sugar, but the two who wandered about
among its thunderous machinery were thinking of
an alien sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>“I must write a note to my good man for you to
take back with you,” Mrs. Gilderoy remarked after
a time, and she went into the bungalow to do it.
Mrs. Lewin and Rennie sat silent. She did not notice
that he was plaiting a frill of her gown between
his confident fingers; his presence was as little to
her as the fireflies and lamp-beetles starring the
grass, for she was thinking of Ally. It was one of
her hours of remorse when an intolerable sense of
responsibility for the ceasing of his strong young
vitality bowed her with irresistible force. At such
moments she would have sacrificed all her after life
to his memory, and done penance because she felt
herself the indirect cause of a fate she could not
foresee. When she was less morbid she saw that
even a strong woman cannot stand between a weak
man and the consequence of his own actions, but
her torturing conscience accused her of complicity
with Gregory because for the space of some weeks
she had allowed herself to be happy. At such moments
she did not plead innocence of any participation
in his darker plans; she felt that to expiate
her own sin she must sacrifice both herself and him
for all the years of strong life that lay before them.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew you better, Mrs. Lewin,” Rennie
said suddenly.</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked, coming back to the present
with a start. She looked down at his young good
looks and audacious eyes, and realised that he had
been playing with her gown, which she quietly
drew away.</p>

<p>“I should so like to call you by your Christian
name,” said Rennie, with the happy safety of his
youth. Women never snubbed him very severely,
because the flushed colour of his face suggested the
school-boy still.</p>

<p>Leoline smiled a little whimsically. “That is the
disadvantage of going by a general nickname,” she
said good-naturedly, supposing that the compromising
“Chum” on so many lips had tempted him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean your nickname,” he said
somewhat loftily. “Every one uses that—all the
women, at least. They have made it common.
But I envy Gurney when he sings that song about
you.” He began to hum “Leoline.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We sang our songs together till the stars shook in the skies—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We spoke—we spoke of common things, but the tears were in our eyes.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“I always think it is a little high-flown for every
day,” said Mrs. Lewin, with a view to the salutary
effect of being matter-of-fact. A big, white moon
was shining down the valley and silvering the sweep
of cane, and the fireflies and intoxicating scents
made sentiment a little excusable.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t call you Leoline,” said Rennie, with
a conscious sense of his own cleverness in distinction.
“I should shorten it for every day, as you
say. I like Leo better. No one calls you Leo.”</p>

<p>She rose abruptly, with a movement of protest
beyond the power of control, and walked to the
further end of the stoep, remarking, “I am sorry
that I do not feel inclined to accord the privilege.”</p>

<p>Just a boy’s light words! Yet she remembered
with a rush of pain how, long since, Mrs. Churton
had asked leave to call her Chum, and she had said
yes, and Mrs. Gilderoy had apologised for using her
husband’s name for her. She had not cared—“Every
one calls me Chum!” she had said lightly,
and the name had grown, as Rennie said, common.
Yet the sound of that natural contraction of Leoline
on other lips than Gregory’s had aroused all the
tigress in her to defend a sacred right. It was
Gregory’s name for her—one, curiously enough,
that no one else had ever used, even in her home-life
before her marriage. As Rennie said, “No one
calls you Leo”—no one, that is, before a prying
public. In the sanctity of their closer love it had
been the dearest of sounds to her, the little tender
name that his suppressed voice had made a mere
whisper for her ears alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>She leaned there, at the end of the stoep, looking
out into the blaze of the moonlight which greyed
the wooded mountains, and made the cane a magic
harvest for fairies to reap. She longed at this moment
for some one to confide her doubts to, and the
tumult in her mind, and curiously enough her
thoughts turned to Mrs. Ritchie Stern, the comparative
stranger with the sea winds haunting her blue
eyes—the wife who loved her husband, and had
spoken of children to a childless woman....
Some pulse seemed to beat and burn in Leoline’s
bosom. Her heart turned to water in her, and all
her life demanded the man she had been schooling
herself to renounce—demanded not only him, but
to be completed in him, bound by the strong tie of
the flesh that earth at least can give, be the communion
of saints what it may in Heaven.</p>

<p>The most pitiful and natural outcry ever put into
a woman’s mouth, was that despairing “I loved him—and
I did not bear his child!” It is very indecent,
because no woman who is not indemnified by
law and the Church has any right to feel the life
quicken in her veins for any man, no matter how
much her mate by instinct and suitability. She
may, however, ask God’s blessing on a loveless
union, and know that she lies through every vow
she makes, and then—the joys of the flesh are no
more lust! Without a legal right love itself is a
sin, but the woman who is so forgetful of convention
that she can yearn for the natural outcome of
childbirth is pilloried in every moral market-place
of the world. It seems a pity that, since we have
accepted the decalogue, nature must always be immoral;
but looked at in one sense even the marriage
service is only sanctifying a breach of divine
commandment. Leoline Lewin was traditional
enough to feel her modesty damaged by her own
unruly pulses. There was an accusation in every
memory of Gregory’s clasp, and yet she could not conscientiously
confess herself repentant, or say in truth
that she would undo one moment of that too-keen
pleasure. She looked up blankly at the inscrutable
heavens, serenely blue and out of reach of question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“How can one repent for being perfectly happy?”
she said.</p>

<p>The Administrator stepped out of the writing-room
quickly, through the ever-open window,
tripped, and nearly fell headlong on the stoep. He
looked down, as he caught the vine-clad pillar, to
see what had nearly wrought his destruction. A
man, a half-caste, lay huddled at his feet, in an
attitude so like death that a stranger would have
been deceived. Evelyn Gregory had seen that
death-sleep before; he bent down closely, pushed
the man over with his foot, and sniffed the heavy
breath that came every thirty seconds or so through
the open mouth. Then he stood up again, erect, at
his full six feet three inches, and looked across the
gardens of Government House, that seemed to drift
away into glades of fainter and fainter colour, until
it was only a green glow. His active eyes may
have seen the vegetation, but they certainly saw
something else—a picture inside his head rather
than outside. After a second he raised his voice
and called.</p>

<p>Two Arabs answered the Administrator’s summons,
on the principle that Saadat el basha (his Excellency)
usually demanded strenuous tasks too heavy
for one man. Gregory looked with steady, lidless
eyes from them to the apparently lifeless body, and
pointed to it with a curt gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>“Take that away,” he said in his horribly under-breathed
voice, “and lay him somewhere to recover.
He is not dead—he has been smoking ganja.” He
paused, looked down at the helpless body, and
added three words whose bestial insult they could
understand—“<i>Ya ibn kelb!</i>” (This is not even
Malagasy—it is Arabic, and it conveys that your
parentage was not all it might be with advantage
to yourself.)</p>

<p>The Arabs lifted the half-caste native, and carried
him away out of range of Gregory’s savage eyes.
He was a sais in their phrase—a Zanzalaky or
pony-boy in Key Island, and attached to the Government
House stables. Why he had crawled on
to the stoep in the state he was when he had fallen
asleep they did not ask. It was a disaster sent by
Allah, and would bring him the kourbash, which
was their name for Gregory’s shambok.</p>

<p>The Administrator continued his interrupted way,
walked off the stoep, and was half across the grass
when he spied a pony trotting up the drive, and
turned aside to speak to the rider. No man trotted
in such heat save one in Key Island, and that was
the O.C.T. Gregory turned back with him to the
house.</p>

<p>“Just the man I wanted!” he said. “I was
coming down to the club to look for you. Come
in here.”</p>

<p>Churton threw his leg over his pony’s neck, polo
fashion, and dropped off, a groom appearing as if by
magic to take the animal. There were so many servants
always waiting on noiseless bare feet at Government
House that it was rarely necessary to shout
as Gregory had done.</p>

<p>“I’ve just had a warning,” said the Administrator,
leading the way back into the room he had left.
“Sit down—whiskey or cého?”</p>

<p>“Whiskey, thanks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>“A man was lying in a drunken sleep just outside
that window,” said the Administrator, with a backward
nod, as he opened the soda-water for his guest
himself, and poured in the spirit. “He must have
been there a very short time—he will lie like that
for three days now.”</p>

<p>Churton raised the glass.</p>

<p>“Here’s to you!” he said significantly. “What
was it? Hemp?”</p>

<p>“Yes—ganja. They have given up brewing it
because we were watching for the still, but they’ve
got some of the crop, and they are teaching the
natives to smoke it like opium. It means a fresh
raid.”</p>

<p>“And more slaughter! Well, I shall be glad of
a little diversion.” An ugly, dark look flitted over
the soldier’s face, and wrinkled his broad forehead.
There seemed more grey in his thick dark hair of
late, and a line of pain round the firm lips. “Any
notion where the trouble rises?” he said.</p>

<p>“I have an idea that it’s beyond China Town, in
that valley between the Tableland and Hashish.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow, there’s no way through—it’s
all ‘dirty,’ and as full of scrub as it can be. I
came down that way from shooting on the Tableland
and found it nearly impassable. No room for
crops.”</p>

<p>“There’s room for storage. I don’t mean in the
valley itself, but nearer the Little Zambesi. Anyhow
I shall raid Sand Bay. There are caves there.”</p>

<p>Churton sat thoughtfully for a minute, the tumbler
in his strong brown hand. He felt desperately
that he would be glad of a scrimmage, if only the
beggars would show fight. But when was a coloured
man game enough?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>“They’ve been quiet for this last month or so,”
he said regretfully. “Ever since that little demonstration
in your garden here.”</p>

<p>“That was a flash in the pan—it meant nothing.”</p>

<p>“It only frightened Mrs. Lewin. Have you heard
anything of her, by the way?”</p>

<p>“She is still at Vohitra.”</p>

<p>“I know. My wife talks of going out there when
Mrs. Gilderoy returns. She can’t stand her in the
same house.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen Mrs. Lewin for some weeks—not
since she went out, in fact,” said Gregory deliberately.
He looked at the man before him as if
measuring him, almost stealthily, and licked his lips
to moisten them in the tigerish fashion peculiar to
him before some inhuman effort. Churton was not
looking at him; he leaned forward, his elbows on
his knees, one hand still holding the half-empty
tumbler, the other hanging loosely against his puttee.
The massive lines of his head and neck were thrown
into prominence by the forward thrust of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Strong man to strong man!” said Gregory
rapidly to his own heart. “And I like him ...
but some one must go under. He has to be the
sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lewin declines to see me,” he said slowly,
choosing his words with care. “She not unnaturally
connects me with her husband’s death, as I was the
unfortunate cause of his going to East Africa. Not
being very logical she forgets her own anxiety that
Captain Lewin should have a chance to show what
stuff he was made of. Well, he showed it—but as
I gave him the chance, his wife gives me the
blame!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>Churton nodded without speaking. His attitude
was sympathetic so far. Then Gregory did one of
those things that had made men follow his order
into death itself, and die silent, having bought him
life, and—what he valued more—success. A touch
of human weakness in his almost inhuman strength
had been his great coup on occasions which had
never been recorded, for something in his personality
attracted men and women alike of an infinitely
higher type than himself, and when he used that
magnetism it had never failed him.</p>

<p>He laid his hand on Churton’s shoulder, and his
quick panting voice was a broken whisper.</p>

<p>“Churton, I’m desperate! She is everything to
me—but her husband, dead, is a stronger barrier
even than living. She is making a shrine of his
memory, and thinks she must be faithful to it.”</p>

<p>The real secret of Gregory’s influence was that
his appeal was genuine, though made with a further
end in view. He did not lay bare his secrets for a
light reason. He could feel his own earnestness
touching Bute Churton in spite of self-interest and
the reserve of training and tradition. He looked
up with a haggard face that would have shaken any
resolution less ruthless than Gregory’s.</p>

<p>“Is that how it is?” he said quietly. “Well, you
have my best wishes. And you can tell her that
she owes no allegiance to her husband’s memory, I—knew
him more intimately than she. Men do
know each other so—see? He was not faithful
to her, even after six months.” He paused, set the
empty tumbler on the table as if in complete control
of his nerves, and added in the same level tone:
“You had better make her understand that Lewin
was no ideal for her to cherish. Otherwise—she is
a good woman—she might not listen to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Gregory drew a breath of relief that caught itself
in his throat. The thing he had suspected was confirmed—at
least he had tacit consent from Churton
to use his suspicion. The sacrifice of the man before
him in extracting such a bitter confession was,
as always, a second consideration to his own gain.
He held an advantage now to use in his own behalf
with Leoline Lewin, and if it had been necessary to
drag Churton through the mire of mentioning his
wife’s very name he would not have stopped at doing
so, nor did he doubt his own success. He was
quick to reckon chances, and the vulnerable points
of those with whom he had to deal—such insight
had been a necessity to him. He knew that the
more generous nature had been touched by the unlocking
of his own secret; nothing less would have
worked on him to admit as much as he had. He
took his hand off Churton’s shoulder, and said,
“Thank you, old fellow!” as simply as a school-boy,
and Churton thought himself rewarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>There was truth, too, in his saying that he was
desperate. A kind of hunger for the woman he
loved possessed him, and he had not seen her to
speak to since the night when he betrayed himself
by a too-great anxiety to bind her to him. She
had withdrawn herself beyond reach of his immediate
influence, and he dared not force her to an encounter.
Twice he had been at Port Albert, and
had found Vohitra closed to him—by Mrs. Lewin’s
own request he paid her no visit of condolence.
He could not realise that the tie between them was
not endangered by absence, or that material things
had no influence upon Leoline’s feelings for him.
A man loves with his five senses; but a woman
with all her instincts and a few over. It does not
really matter to her if he is ill-favoured, or has given
her a badly-cooked dinner, or a world divides them,
or he talks about himself, or some one has burnt the
fat and the smell is pervading the house—so long as
he is her chosen to her she can go on love-making,
in fancy if need be, without distraction. But you
must satisfy the eyes, and the palate, and the longing
touch, and the egotistical ear, and the sensitive
nose, before a man is well pleased and thinks tenderly
of the opposite sex. Long before Leoline
Lewin was ripe for seeing him again, Gregory was
fretting because he thought his influence slackened
by distance. He wanted to bring the power of his
personality to bear again before he could feel sure
of his ultimate success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>At first, as the days lengthened into weeks, he
had been patient to let her recover from the shock
of her husband’s death, to go away and mourn for
him if need be, for decency’s sake. But he had
meant to see her under the cloak of a conventional
sympathy, and when he found himself denied her
presence he chafed, and then, risking Mrs. Gilderoy’s
eyes, he wrote to her. It had been difficult to
answer, in the face of her own renewed desire, but
she had quietly demanded time. She was going
home next mail; she would see him to say good-bye,
and they might meet again in England. Her
date of meeting had a far-off sound, and he realised
that conventional widowhood meant at least a year’s
probation. To the man of immediate action, a man
like Gregory, such flimsy delays were irritating;
and yet he recognised the importance of social
standing, and the slur of a hurried marriage. At
least he must force a definite promise before the
mail arrived and she slipped beyond his grasp, and
even to do this meant a violation of her husband’s
memory. It was then that Gregory thought of certain
hints he had heard of his A.D.C. and the
women of the station, for Halton had carried adder’s
poison under his tongue to justify his own devotion
in the earlier days of his intimacy with Mrs. Lewin.
Absorbed in weightier matters, and contemptuous
of gossip, Gregory had not interested himself in
such slight things as Alaric Lewin’s infidelities, and
when his need came, he could remember nothing
but an outline. He did not know, however, whither
his incompetent <i>aide</i> had always been lured away
from duty, and his own savage strictures on tennis
and Maitso recurred to him. The inference was
natural, and with a broad master-stroke of policy,
he drained Diana’s husband for information—the
man most unlikely to know on the surface of things,
the man most likely to know in Gregory’s sardonic
experience of such situations. These things always
leaked out, and worked to silent tragedies between
husband and wife. Churton would know—and for
his own ends Evelyn Gregory could make use even
of a dead man’s gallantries.</p>

<p>Up in the silence of Vohitra a runner brought a
letter to Leoline Lewin a day or so after Churton
had spoken with the Administrator. At the sight
of the handwriting her heart stood still again, and
she did not think to look at the messenger, who,
according to the date of the missive, should have
been there before. There was a restless excitement
about the man, half fear, half exultation, for he
brought other news than that in the letter—but
Mrs. Lewin found her own sufficient for the moment,
and read and re-read the small characteristic writing
as if fascinated.</p>

<p>Gregory was never merciful. He tore the last of
her illusions from her, and laid bare a grisly truth—though
he did it in decent words—without compunction.
Certain sentences in that letter seemed
to buzz in her ears without keeping the connection.
They meant nothing, and yet they meant so
much.</p>

<p>“If you are refusing to see me from a feeling of
loyalty to Captain Lewin your sacrifice is thrown
away, for he was not loyal to you....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>No? Not even the faith in her married life left
to her? Married one short year, and she could not
keep her husband’s fidelity—she felt the humiliation
of the bald statement in Gregory’s words. It had
been another of her theories that a woman like herself
could keep any man. It seemed that all her
virtues and attractions had not prevented Alaric
from straying. And where had he strayed? With
innocent conceit she had seen herself the fairest,
best-gowned, quickest-witted woman, at all events
in the little shoddy Station. But it appeared that
she was less invincible than she thought. Other
sentences in that letter followed to enlighten her.</p>

<p>“I am not speaking on my own authority.
Other men—Major Churton principally—confirm
my assertion that your husband was no pattern of
fidelity. You can guess for whom he left you—we
need not attack his memory for a thing that is over
and done with. But to vow to be true to one who
could hardly demand it as due to him is making the
position ridiculous....</p>

<p>“I am only supposing that this is what has
closed your heart to me. But am I not at least as
worthy of allegiance as Lewin? Understand that
it was not merely a venial sin, such as you may call
your own during his absence—I have Churton’s
testimony, poor fellow....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Then it was as if a blaze of pain blotted out the
words of the letter for a moment. She saw and
recognised many things in that sacrifice of Bute
Churton’s name. Di ... and Ally! The horrible
vulgarity of it, the degradation of even her
slight friendship with the woman, made her revolt.
She could have forgiven it better had he done such
a thing with half a world between them, even though
his partner in guilt had professed to like her; but in
the narrow confines of Port Victoria it seemed
abominable. Her last ideal was torn from her, and
the worst of it was that in the light of Ally’s backsliding
she saw what her own had nearly been. In
her thoughts, her desires, perhaps, she had been
worse, since his passions, like his whole nature, were
slighter than her own. She rose to her feet in that
intolerable revelation, the letter crushed in her hand
... and for the first time she saw, consciously,
the native runner who had brought it.</p>

<p>He had been waiting with hideous eagerness to
catch her attention. The minute he saw that she
was looking at him with expectation he babbled
with speech, his head nodding vaguely towards the
way he had come, childish eagerness and horrid enjoyment
in his face.</p>

<p>“I heap big trouble to come through, Missus.
The land is up—they dance the Cannab dance in
Po’ Victoria.”</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and her wide blazing eyes
held his like a snake’s.</p>

<p>“What is that you say? Tell me more. What
has happened?”</p>

<p>“You hear nothing hyar? No—the ra not reach
you. The Panjaka-Baas——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gregory—the Administrator—yes?” She
knew that queer native jumble of a title for him, for
panjaka means king or head lord, and the South
African baas or master had drifted into Key Island
with the white man’s authority.</p>

<p>“First he burn the Cannab—but the Chiney man
he keep back some. Then the Panjaka-Baas he
guess there is some still, for the nigger still get
drunk.” He rubbed his hands and grinned as if in
delighted reminiscence. “They make a raid at
Sand Bay and find the Cannab cane—lots an’ lots
hidden there! And <i>then</i> the land is up and they
dance!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>Leoline, without turning her eyes away, as though
afraid he might escape if she did, called, “Mrs. Gilderoy!”
Her friend answered her from the house,
and a minute later came out on to the stoep, with a
sharp glance of surprise at the runner.</p>

<p>“He brought me a letter,” Mrs. Lewin explained
briefly. “He comes from Port Victoria. Tell this
lady what you have told me!” she commanded.</p>

<p>The native did so, laughing inanely through the
narrative, and helped on by Leoline’s prompting.
“Ra!” (blood) said the native. “Heaps ra!” The
two women looked at each other with ashen faces.</p>

<p>“Is it true, do you think?” Mrs. Lewin said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—but I must go to my husband,”
said Mrs. Gilderoy decidedly.</p>

<p>“I thought you might wish.”</p>

<p>“I shall get down to Port Albert to-night, and
take to-morrow’s boat. I can telephone through
from there too. If only we had one here!”</p>

<p>“No telephone. Wires cut!” jabbered the
runner.</p>

<p>“Oh, good heavens!... Will you come
too, or remain here?” said Mrs. Gilderoy, controlling
herself and turning to Mrs. Lewin.</p>

<p>“I shall stay here—at present. There is nothing
I could do there, and I should only be in the way
with no man to look after me. In a few days I may
come round, the mail is nearly due.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, the land is up—that means that
the natives have risen all over the island, I expect.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am!” said Mrs. Gilderoy honestly.
“Afraid for my husband, if not for myself. Can’t
we get more news out of this creature? Make him
speak, Chum, for goodness sake, or I shall kill him
with kourbash! My riding-crop is heavy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p>“Tell us more,” said Mrs. Lewin briefly to the
native. “Are any matz (dead) of this ra?” (blood).
She mixed up Malagasy and English in her desperation.</p>

<p>“Many, Missus, the soldiers charge, and the
people fall. But they kill one baas—yes, an
officer!”</p>

<p>“Who? Who was it? What was his name?”
Mrs. Gilderoy, like a leaping fury, had seized him
by the shoulder and shook him in a frenzy of fear,
so that he could only chatter and jabber at her incoherently.
She was suddenly transformed to a
mad woman in her anxiety. Beneath all her worldly
wisdom and ironical remarks on the married state,
she loved one man, and that was Wray Gilderoy.
It was strange how this bitter-tongued couple had
kept the sweetness of their union beneath all their
jeering at other people’s matrimony. Leoline felt
it a real and consequently a precious thing, while
she gently disengaged the native from Mrs. Gilderoy’s
clutch.</p>

<p>“You are only frightening him—he cannot speak
to tell you,” she said. “Now think, Zanzalaky—what
is the name of the officer who is—who is—killed?”</p>

<p>“’Milton Gourney, Missus!”</p>

<p>“Gourney—Gurney! Hamilton Gurney! Oh,
poor young fellow!”</p>

<p>She remembered the one thing that people always
did distinguish in Gurney’s vapid individuality—his
voice. All the soul of the man seemed to lie in
that good gift, and a lump rose in her throat at the
memory of the songs that were hushed for ever.
It seemed as wicked to have shot him as to shoot a
nightingale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Gilderoy had dropped into the nearest
chair, and was moaning hysterically in her relief.
The women she had laughed at for a too-demonstrative
attachment to their husbands could have taken
an ample revenge could they have seen her then.
But Mrs. Lewin felt only the deeper side of it, and
saw no bathos in the rocking, undignified figure,
tortured with being a woman and impotent while
the man she cared for was exposed to danger in the
proper course of things. They seemed to her to
have left self-consciousness behind them and the
shame that dogs an exhibition of real feeling, so
that Vohitra always appeared in Leoline’s memory
as a little stage and scenic effects to the intensity of
two or three figures—her own and Mrs. Gilderoy’s
at the present moment.</p>

<p>She had no time to think of herself and her private
anxiety during the next few hours, through
which it seemed to her she felt neither heat nor tire,
but pushed the frightened useless black servants
aside and packed her friend’s belongings for her
with capable hands. It was only when Mrs. Gilderoy
had stumbled away down the hillside, hardly
guiding her pony for the first time on record, that
she had the leisure to face her own intolerable dread.
Her cheek was wet where Mrs. Gilderoy had kissed
her, but not with her own tears. She had no open
right to cry, but she looked at the letter which had
seemed only a new dismay a few hours ago, and
thought that it might be the last she should ever
receive in that handwriting....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>For if there were any concerted attack, and organised
hate in the brain maddened by hashish and
ganja, it would all be directed against the Administrator.
Gregory was the man to fall, by treachery
or open warfare, and she recognised the maddening
position she was in by being cut off from news.
Even if she went down to Port Albert the telephone
wires were cut, and they were dependent for information
on the little coasting steamers which at best
were irregular. When Mrs. Gilderoy had asked if
she would stay at Vohitra or come back with her,
Leoline had answered with the unselfish impulse of
her love, seeing in a flash of comprehension that
her presence would only hamper Gregory, and paralyse
his action with a private anxiety. She had
not thought of herself at all in that moment, nor
did she regret her decision now by the light of reason;
but her heart cried out in its distress that her
place was with him, and that not to know of his
safety was unbearable, with a desire as great as Mrs.
Gilderoy’s. She had no right to act the weak
woman, and please herself at the expense of the
man she loved—no right justified, like Mrs. Gilderoy’s,
by years of open marriage. Gregory would
believe her safe at Vohitra, and be freer to use the
brain and nerve, in which she took some comfort,
remembering the night when he had cleared the
stoep, alone, with no weapon but a shambok. But
she realised, during the next few days, that she
had set herself the hardest task that a woman
can—to wait and endure the anxiety in silence,
that a man may feel her a helpmate, and not a
burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>Life went on the same in the Tsara Valley in
spite of the panic that threatened the whole island.
The coloured people were cutting the cane, driven
by the dogged wills of a few strong white men,
whose grim determination triumphantly proved
them once more the dominant race. The planters
saved their crops as if nothing had happened to
upset the usual routine of harvest, and though
labour was scarce, they quietly forced the natives
who had not been drawn to the centre of trouble to
work as usual. There had been a meeting at Port
Albert, and a concerted plan of action agreed upon
amongst those men most experienced in the island,
the result being that the rioting in the other districts
hardly affected the little seaport, and the sugar harvest
was not ruined. Gradually the influence of
these few men made itself felt amongst the dangerous
numbers of mixed races; and Mrs. Lewin, from
the stoep at Vohitra, saw the dark forms bending in
the furrows, the mellowing blades falling, and, leaving
the ground shorn of its gold-green glory, the
trucks pass up and down the whole sweep of the
valley, while the factory smoked through the long,
hot days. Once the town warden rode out to pay
her a hurried visit, and give her what news he could;
but he was a busy man—Gregory’s representative,
and the despot of the town—and could spare but
little time. He left some of his own servants at
Vohitra whom he could trust, and asked Mrs.
Lewin quietly if she could charge and fire a revolver.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said briefly, remembering that Gregory
had asked her the same question once before, at
the last threatened rising.</p>

<p>“I have brought you one of mine—you had
better keep it by you,” Ambroise said cheerfully.
“I don’t think there will be the least necessity for
it, but it is as well that the people about you should
know you are armed.”</p>

<p>“Have you any news?”</p>

<p>“The island is quieting down, and I do not think
anyhow it would spread out this way. But there
has been real fighting at Port Victoria, and the
troops were called out. One poor fellow was killed
in the first skirmish—Hamilton Gurney. Did you
know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I used to admire his voice so much.
Poor fellow! How was it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>“There was a rush in the Square, and they got
him up against the Market buildings. You know
those steps? He was trying to get through the
mob with some girl, and they stabbed him with a
razor they had looted from a private house. No
one knows who did it, of course.”</p>

<p>“Where were the troops?”</p>

<p>“They arrived on the scene three minutes later.
It was very sudden—those risings always are—and
Gurney had no warning. He was not in uniform
at all, or with his men—he had been in town, and
was going to ride out to Maitso, but he had not had
any orders even.”</p>

<p>“And the girl?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the girl is all right, except that she had
hysterics. Two or three white people were
wounded, and about a hundred niggers have been
killed—I wish it had been a thousand!” said Ambroise
savagely. “But I think they have had a
lesson.”</p>

<p>“Port Victoria is quiet, then? I wonder if I
might go round? The mail is almost due,” she
added with an instinct of caution to veil her real
reason.</p>

<p>“Well, it is getting that way, but I think you are
better off here at present. It was the most sensible
thing you could do to stop here. The place will be
lamb-like when you do see it again. As far as
Key’land goes such a rising was just what was
wanted.”</p>

<p>“But the loss of life!” she exclaimed with a
shudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t help that, and you can only teach the
natives respect for the British Empire by a military
lesson delivered some time or other. Last time,
you see, they got off with a warning, and we all felt
that once the troops were here they ought to be
punished. Most places catch it that have Gregory
as Administrator, and are chastened afterwards.
He is the right man in the right place—I’d rather
work under him than any man who comes out with
a theory of ‘It’s all done by kindness.’”</p>

<p>She tried to keep her face from tingling, and
smiled faintly. “You are almost as drastic in your
views as the Administrator. Has he—has he come
out of the fray unscathed?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right—so far.” Ambroise laughed,
unknowing that his words frightened her. “He has
given them a dose of Gregory’s Powder, and they
are making wry faces over it. But he is a man who
always carries his life in his hand, Mrs. Lewin—he
always will, wherever he is.”</p>

<p>She turned away, sick at heart. In her ignorance
of the fate that pressed her rapidly, she pictured
herself far off from Gregory, in England, thinking of
those words that his admiring lieutenant had said.
Wherever he might go he would carry his life in
his hand, from his savage unofficialism that never
got into the papers, and she for a year at least would
be as helpless and uncognisant of his movements
and fate as she was now. She had no premonition
that those whose lives were interwoven with Gregory’s
were whirled into quick action with his overmastering
vitality, and hurried out of the usual
course of events. Life always went quickly with
him. He did not lose time through being handicapped
by red tape of any description, as his Service
was grimly aware. But these things were hid
in secret drawers at the Colonial Office, and filed for
censure about once in every appointment that
Evelyn Gregory had ever had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gilderoy had been gone but three or four
days when in the evening of that following Ambroise’s
visit one of the servants brought Leoline a
note from her, saying that it had come by a messenger
who was waiting. Mrs. Lewin had been sitting
at the improvised writing-table in her own bedroom—one
of those passion-haunted rooms from
whose suggested associations she could never get
away after Mrs. Gilderoy had put the fancy into her
head. With the note in her hand she rose at once
and went across the passage and out on to the
stoep, because the natives usually waited there.
Her long black gown swished across the bare boards
as she went, where other women’s had whispered in
the same feminine tongue during long-dead summers.</p>

<p>“—except poor Gurney, who paid the forfeit of
his life for running after Trixie Denver anyhow.
How matters stood between them one doesn’t know,
but the girl is behaving as if she were his <i>fiancée</i> at
least—if not his widow! She goes about in deep
mourning——”</p>

<p>Leoline put the letter on one side to read presently,
raised her eyes as she came out on to the
stoep, and saw Evelyn Gregory.</p>

<p>The sun was setting behind Vohitra, but the
house faced north-east, and the late long beams still
struck that side of the stoep where they met. Their
faces were in the shadow, the dusty light only bathing
them warmly to the waist, and she saw that
there was some strong purpose in his seeking her
here even as she met his eyes. For a minute she
seemed to wait between one life and another before
he spoke—the old theoretical life of her untried
girlhood, dear with the bright things of the world,
that even her wifehood had left unaltered; and the
deeper painful realities of existence that he had
called into being for her. She knew, before he
spoke, that a decision awaited her now, as to
whether she should pass definitely from one to the
other, and it seemed to her that she hardly faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>“I have come to you to put a choice before you,”
he said, even as he took her hand and held it in his
strong grip. He gave her no conventional greeting,
though so much had happened since they had said
good-bye in the bungalow ... the night
before she got Ally’s letter. “I have very little time
to spare—I must go back in an hour at most. The
town is under my authority at present, and I am
responsible.”</p>

<p>His word told her enough. “You have been recalled!”
she said quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes; Halton has reached England,” he said
significantly. “But apart from any private pulling
of the strings, I expected this—perhaps. There
was just a chance I might wire through, but it was
unlikely. They are sending out another man.”</p>

<p>“From England?”</p>

<p>“Ultimately. From Capetown at present.”</p>

<p>“And you go home?”</p>

<p>“As things now stand—officially. But I have
private information that I am to go to Central
Africa again.”</p>

<p>“Is this”—she moistened her dry lips—“because
of Port Cecil?”</p>

<p>“Partly, I suppose. It was touch-and-go there
after Lewin’s death.” (Did he ever shrink before
a name? She could not have spoken so.) “But
Melton Hanney pulled the Empire out of a war.
He should get something for that!” He smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>“You have heard from Capetown?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“I have.” He spoke more grimly still. Into
his hard eyes flashed the passing soreness of a
spoiled ambition. And he had meant to do so
much with that insignificant tool, Key Island!—to
make it so much the very centre of warring
destinies that no one in after years could speak of
it without an historical significance. He knew, as
even she could not understand, the result of the
thing he had dared to do, and he saw his future,
perhaps, as another man did, “behind him!” For
one cannot stake Empires and not lose something,
even though one win a private and personal gain.
Something was left him out of the wreck on which
to begin to build anew—a fresh incentive to rise in
the fair woman before him, whom he had coveted
to the height of tossing lives aside for her, and committing
tacit murder. He stretched out his hands
and took hers gently.</p>

<p>“Will you come into the wilderness with me?”
he said, with a curious little smile. “Dare you be
my wife and share my fortunes—now?”</p>

<p>For a second she half drew back, not at the thing
he suggested, but the hurry it implied. “At once—so
soon?” breathed her training.</p>

<p>“At once—so soon!” he echoed, not one line of
concession in his face or voice. “That wherever I
go I may take you with me. I am not offering you
an easy position, or an establishment in life, I assure
you! I am a man who wants his wife beside him,
wherever it is possible. I shall very likely want you
where most men would say it was not possible. If
you are afraid for your children, it may mean parting
from them, or if we can make a home where
other men give up all hope of family ties, I shall
ask you to risk it.”</p>

<p>“I am not <i>afraid</i>!” she said proudly, but rather
breathlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“Except for the weight of public opinion against
a hurried marriage? I meant to spare you that.
But things are worse with me than I hoped they
might be, and the stroke fell more swiftly.” He set
his teeth and thought of Halton. “I have not much
to offer you!” he said, and his voice had suddenly
hoarsened. “But I think you love me—I know I
love you. There is trouble for us in the future, but
I have still the fighting powers that have made me
what I am. I can give you love, and strength to
win you back the position that I have imperilled for
you.” His voice sharpened still more with sudden
fear, and his hands tightened on hers. Even she
did not realise how great the dread of losing her had
been, but it drove him almost to an appeal. “Leo,
in common humanity you will not turn from me
now?”</p>

<p>How much we mean by that word humanity!
It contains all the virtues with which we do not
credit God. Perhaps Leoline felt that a little more
was being asked of her than the simply human
side would have acceded, but the diviner spark
burned up to meet the demand upon it. She looked
into his compelling eyes, and in that moment of her
love, perfected, she cast out fear for ever.</p>

<p>“I will come with you!” was all she said; and
it was her arms as well as his that drew them
together.</p>

<p>“God bless you!” she heard him say with the
old under-breathed voice she knew, and that had
thrilled her out of all theories into the pain and
glory of womanhood. “God keep you safely, and
bless you, my darling!” It is when a strong man
loves something better than himself that he feels his
impotence, and hastens to charge it on the Deity he
affects to do well without, himself. The most irreligious
men are always ready to pray above the
heads nearest and dearest to them. Gregory, who
would have snapped any commandment left undefended
by law, called on the Unknown God to do
the one thing of which he felt himself incapable.
With the woman he had loved in his arms he fell
back on an instinct which is greater even than
habit—</p>

<p>“God bless you, because you are my darling!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>The sun had reached the hill crest, and his last
level glow touched their faces at last with unnatural
fire. For a minute Leoline was dazzled, but through
the haze she looked out over the half-reaped valley,
and it was as if she saw Key Island in symbol, the
strange little place to which she had come so light-heartedly
to find fate and tragedy there. His glance
followed hers, but he saw nothing of the peaceful
harvest or rest at evening time. To his steady gaze
the red light was War and his future wrapped in
smoke. He did not fear, and he did not repent, because
he had long since counted the cost, and reckoned
it as gain; but he knew, as that old-time counterpart
of his sin had known, that there was no
peace for him or his—and that because he had despised
the unwritten law, War should be his portion
for ever, as clearly as if the prophet had said to him
also, “Now therefore the sword shall never depart
from thine house!”</p>

<p>And the woman for whom he had sinned knew
also that there was a shadow on their lives for ever,
cast by the man they had sacrificed, and that she
could never dare to look her love bravely in the
face without that dark reservation that she thrust
out of sight. She did not repent either—with her
hand in that of the man she loved she was ready to
go with him into the wilderness as he had said, and
let him lead her where he would, the stony places
were gentle so long as it was his path also. But
her eyes, as they looked over the golden transfigured
valley, held all the pain of the love that is
earth-marred, and she knew that the tragedy of her
life lay in that sealing of their destinies.</p>

from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
